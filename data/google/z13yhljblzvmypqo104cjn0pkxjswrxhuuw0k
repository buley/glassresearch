Using this video he can see himself and help improve his form. Also videoing our time together while on vacation or on a trip.<br /><br />Along with this, being that I&#39;m a web developer and have a long travel time in the morning, I would use it in tangent with a mobile web application to record my MPG on my gas guzzling truck or my more gas efficient motorcycle.  This would be shared in real time as I fill up each time to create a historical view.  The glasses would be extremely handy on a motorcycle for quickness and ease while on long trips. Taking a picture of the gas pump after filling or just videoing my ride along the highway to share my experiences with others would be great!","url":"https://plus.google.com/117184036590475407861/posts/NhM51wpWLMH","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13yhljblzvmypqo104cjn0pkxjswrxhuuw0k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13yhljblzvmypqo104cjn0pkxjswrxhuuw0k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13yhljblzvmypqo104cjn0pkxjswrxhuuw0k/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
