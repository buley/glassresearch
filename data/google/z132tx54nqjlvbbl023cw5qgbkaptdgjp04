I would use it to film my girlfriends reaction when I propose at the Calgary zoo. If I had glass I would use it to show people my pitbull pulling me on my long board or me mountain biking through through the river valley. I would use Glass to take pictures and record all of the amazing concerts I go to . Maybe even take it on the Amazing Race Canada  if I get selected (fingers crossed)  <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23livinglifetothefullest\">#livinglifetothefullest</a>  ","url":"https://plus.google.com/111234873334433854950/posts/6PkBQkvSznx","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z132tx54nqjlvbbl023cw5qgbkaptdgjp04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z132tx54nqjlvbbl023cw5qgbkaptdgjp04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z132tx54nqjlvbbl023cw5qgbkaptdgjp04/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
