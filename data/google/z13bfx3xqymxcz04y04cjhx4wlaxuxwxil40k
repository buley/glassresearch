I feel not only would it help bring a better understanding to a world pretty much defined by negative media hyperbole, but it would also bring a diverse viewpoint to an evolving field that almost everyone has encountered at least once in their life","url":"https://plus.google.com/117590783214399073468/posts/TRoozefrTnD","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13bfx3xqymxcz04y04cjhx4wlaxuxwxil40k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13bfx3xqymxcz04y04cjhx4wlaxuxwxil40k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13bfx3xqymxcz04y04cjhx4wlaxuxwxil40k/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
