I imagine being able to say &quot;checking balance&quot; and have that show up on Glass while you are in a checkout line, or maybe even initiate payments via voice command (we are a partner with Google Wallet already - we could help build a model that uses Wallet/Glass as the front end, and create the back end banking integration path that others could follow). Amazing possibilities to consider, hope I can participate in the beta!","url":"https://plus.google.com/108791524013289968557/posts/XaH2wVqpifq","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13ofxkbnmqcjft5q04cchlp2p2miffgaxw0k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13ofxkbnmqcjft5q04cchlp2p2miffgaxw0k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13ofxkbnmqcjft5q04cchlp2p2miffgaxw0k/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Mobile"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
