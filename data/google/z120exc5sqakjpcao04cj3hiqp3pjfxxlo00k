I would use glass to be able to record and share real-time roof inspections with fellow consultants, property owners, and insurance adjusters to show them exactly what I am looking at when inspecting a roof. It would allow me as a consultant to finish reports more efficiently; I can take field notes on the spot and update our files in Google drive; finally it would be safer for me to take pictures without using my hands. ","url":"https://plus.google.com/115295567926793597819/posts/cWAUDdV41DH","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z120exc5sqakjpcao04cj3hiqp3pjfxxlo00k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z120exc5sqakjpcao04cj3hiqp3pjfxxlo00k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z120exc5sqakjpcao04cj3hiqp3pjfxxlo00k/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
