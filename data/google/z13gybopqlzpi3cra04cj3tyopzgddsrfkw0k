I am also a mother of two and grandmother of 7. If I had GLASS I could share my experience with all my customers and truly make this a real business venture since we sell phones and accessories for all providers. I have a family of 5 Android phones. We enjoy taking and sharing pictures and media of everything (horseback riding, soccer games, orchestra performances, piano recitals, dance recital, scientific experiments, basket ball games, trips to the zoo and anything you or my children or grandchildren could imagine!) On top of all the activities we truly are fascinated with the Youtube experience. I await the receipt of my acceptance so to further the opportunities for the GLASS. Thank you for your time and consideration. <br />Charlotte Mitchell","url":"https://plus.google.com/101839325064693289384/posts/fWvXjxhNHkt","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13gybopqlzpi3cra04cj3tyopzgddsrfkw0k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13gybopqlzpi3cra04cj3tyopzgddsrfkw0k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13gybopqlzpi3cra04cj3tyopzgddsrfkw0k/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Mobile"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
