I would use it to make some awesome videos while playing snow-paintball. Another sweet use would be to wear it while playing goalie in ice-hockey, imagine all of those wicked videos of a puck coming inches from the camera and bouncing off. I would also use it to make a first person video diary of my family&#39;s vacations. I would upload all of the interesting bits of the week (Paintball to breathtaking scenery) to Youtube, basically documenting the interesting tidbits of my life in an interesting fashion.","url":"https://plus.google.com/101589900069589770568/posts/gvwkQphPaRx","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13hw30g0vqpzrrbi04cfpojnwqjyn5odh4/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13hw30g0vqpzrrbi04cfpojnwqjyn5odh4/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13hw30g0vqpzrrbi04cfpojnwqjyn5odh4/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
