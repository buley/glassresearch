I will ensure a full compliance with patients&#39; confidentiality and provide a full feedback on such amazing experience. NHS hospital  is the major workforce in the UK, and introducing such a system would be of paramount importance. ","url":"https://plus.google.com/108894172756595710144/posts/PK4Ezn6Xpne","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13dtvvg1vf2zzgg504cdx5rwpf2zxdrx30/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13dtvvg1vf2zzgg504cdx5rwpf2zxdrx30/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13dtvvg1vf2zzgg504cdx5rwpf2zxdrx30/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
