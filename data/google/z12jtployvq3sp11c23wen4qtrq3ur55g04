First, I would use it for doing research on my college courses. Second, I would use it for my work, looking up fixes to problems I have with computers. Third, I would use it for navigating when I&#39;m traveling somewhere because it is too difficult to look at my android phone for directions while I&#39;m driving. Fourth, I would use it to show people how much potential it has, making demand for the product to all my peers and co-workers.","url":"https://plus.google.com/107888059664232510266/posts/7hMqSX7tjbk","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12jtployvq3sp11c23wen4qtrq3ur55g04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12jtployvq3sp11c23wen4qtrq3ur55g04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12jtployvq3sp11c23wen4qtrq3ur55g04/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"Google Glass","content":"Have what it takes to be a Glass Explorer?
