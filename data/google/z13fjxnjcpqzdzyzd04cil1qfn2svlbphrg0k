The reasons I upgraded didn&#39;t matter, it was the new things I found I could do. Glass will be like that. I don&#39;t want it for the reasons I know, but for the new things I will find.","url":"https://plus.google.com/113324188473076701031/posts/g8jWAskEHiM","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13fjxnjcpqzdzyzd04cil1qfn2svlbphrg0k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13fjxnjcpqzdzyzd04cil1qfn2svlbphrg0k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13fjxnjcpqzdzyzd04cil1qfn2svlbphrg0k/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
