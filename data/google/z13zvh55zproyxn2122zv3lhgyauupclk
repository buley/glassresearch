I would just like to share with people how I see the world.  I could even put them on the Chihuahua too.","url":"https://plus.google.com/116939380017071249248/posts/ByQch4sMS6z","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13zvh55zproyxn2122zv3lhgyauupclk/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13zvh55zproyxn2122zv3lhgyauupclk/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13zvh55zproyxn2122zv3lhgyauupclk/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"Google Glass","content":"Have what it takes to be a Glass Explorer?
