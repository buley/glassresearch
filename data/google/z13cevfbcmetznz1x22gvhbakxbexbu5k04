You&#39;d see everything I&#39;d eat, even the candied grasshoppers in Thailand and Cambodia! You&#39;d hear the rush of tropical waterfalls, see the crashing waves on Ko Samui, enjoy the smiles of foreign cultures and fall in love with people half way around the world.  I&#39;ll be traveling through SE Asia from Malaysia to Laos and Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia, India, Dubai, Jordan, Europe and I&#39;ll finish up at Oktoberfest in Germany with my friend there! You&#39;d meet my friends I&#39;m traveling with, as well as our mutual friends we&#39;ll be meeting up with in most of the countries mentioned above. Let&#39;s hang out on Google+ in as many countries as possible!  Woohoo!!!","url":"https://plus.google.com/103960051684472780816/posts/BNFHqHXe5xb","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13cevfbcmetznz1x22gvhbakxbexbu5k04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13cevfbcmetznz1x22gvhbakxbexbu5k04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13cevfbcmetznz1x22gvhbakxbexbu5k04/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
