I would share all this things with my classmates, so everyone could get the school material and stuff. Another thing I would like to do is to capture the important moments of my life, so when I get old I would like to see what I&#39;ve done in my life. :) But I do not live in U.S. so I can not apply to test this Google Glass. :( So sad. IÂ´m from Mexico. It would be great to let people from other countries test your fabulous Google Glass.","url":"https://plus.google.com/108141475516757357286/posts/GwZKd6d3KVx","replies":{"totalItems":2,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z133vzdbek2my5dmz23ufnsbpn3lgncd0/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z133vzdbek2my5dmz23ufnsbpn3lgncd0/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z133vzdbek2my5dmz23ufnsbpn3lgncd0/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
