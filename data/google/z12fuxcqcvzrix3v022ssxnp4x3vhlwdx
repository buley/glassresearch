Very similar application to the much anticipated digital contact lens left me with only one question. How can i become a part of Glass? Well, as a pizza delivery driver in constant  need of everthing Glass has to offer, from real time navigation to intant photos. I can privide detailed reports with bugs, or minor malfuntions. Also provide simple suggestions to create a smoother user interface and experience. In daily life I am contantly proposing small changes and offering suggestions on how to improve routine tasks. As the assistant manager of the franchise pizza restaurant, I am responsible for basic paperwork, inventory, orders, and employee morale, often staging small competitions to create a more motivated workplace. <br /><br />In short, there are a number of ways that both Glass and I could benefit from each other. <br />Thank you for your consideration. <br />-Rick","url":"https://plus.google.com/115028931700642197936/posts/H5XKamwqgNz","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12fuxcqcvzrix3v022ssxnp4x3vhlwdx/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12fuxcqcvzrix3v022ssxnp4x3vhlwdx/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12fuxcqcvzrix3v022ssxnp4x3vhlwdx/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"Google Glass","content":"Have what it takes to be a Glass Explorer?
