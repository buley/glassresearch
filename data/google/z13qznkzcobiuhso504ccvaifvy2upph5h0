I spend about 16 hours a day on my phone or my computer. If I had a medium through which I could stay connected to the web, my work, and my networks without sitting down at a computer or squinting and pecking clumsily at a handheld device, I would have more freedom to do the things I love - things like cooking, exercising, and hiking with my dog. I&#39;d be able to stay in touch with the virtual world that demands my attention without being out of touch with the physical world that my attention demands.<br /><br />Gone would be the days marked by incessant backaches from hunching over a keyboard for hours on end. No longer would I have to endure the psychological warfare waged upon me by my canine counterpart as she whimpers by the front door, leash in mouth. And with two free hands I might even have a chance to whip up the fabled blackened sea scallop dish for the particularly attractive neighbor that lives across the way, a task that has gone over-boasted yet under-accomplished for nearly two months.<br /><br />The simple fact is that  <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23ifihadglass\">#ifihadglass</a> , I&#39;d have a few extra moments each day to appreciate the beauty around me and enjoy life&#39;s simple pleasures, such as nature and companionship, without completely cutting the cord and moving to a log cabin in the woods. Thoreau may be turning in his grave right now, but this is a step in the right direction for me.
