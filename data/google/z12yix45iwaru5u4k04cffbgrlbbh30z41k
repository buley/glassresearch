Other algorithms normalize a gallery of face images and then compress the face data, only saving the data in the image that is useful for face detection. A probe image is then compared with the face data.<br />One of the earliest successful systems is based on template...<br /><br />If Google decline my of some reason I would build a lie detector based on algorithm engine to detect if a person you are talking to are lying","url":"https://plus.google.com/107594522760619368262/posts/RDtDRNZioFH","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12yix45iwaru5u4k04cffbgrlbbh30z41k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12yix45iwaru5u4k04cffbgrlbbh30z41k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12yix45iwaru5u4k04cffbgrlbbh30z41k/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"Google Glass","content":"Have what it takes to be a Glass Explorer?
