I would use glass to record and share my comedy from the perspective of the comedian, which to my knowledge hasn&#39;t been done before. There&#39;s even the possibility of incorporating glass into my routine. In addition I am a drummer and have always wanted to share the concert experience from my perspective, but never been able to. I am also pursuing a degree in high school education, and am fascinated by the possibility of using glass in the classroom setting, not only to record my teaching adventures first-person, but also as a teaching tool. As a science teacher, I can only imagine how useful it would be to have a hands-free device to view my notes or search the internet while in the middle of a lab demonstration, without removing my latex gloves or stalling the learning experience. It would also make it possible to quickly record a first-person video tutorial, which is a very exciting and useful prospect. Plus, everyone loves the science teacher with the spacy glasses.","url":"https://plus.google.com/103273540785320882515/posts/71JRAaiJDp7","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13uch2ygtqqwdwt323zsxvzzpjjfj1wu04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13uch2ygtqqwdwt323zsxvzzpjjfj1wu04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13uch2ygtqqwdwt323zsxvzzpjjfj1wu04/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
