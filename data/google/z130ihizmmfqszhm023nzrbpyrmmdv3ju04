To think that I would be able to record my life without having to carry around a huge camera would be great! To make a film about a day of my life, recording what I do without having to carry something like a video camera around, wouldn&#39;t that be great? Google Glass would be perfect: it&#39;s small, lightweight, and you wear it on your head. It isn&#39;t an inconvenience in anyway, and would be a fantastic tool for me to use in day-to-day life. I have a huge fascination in technology, and I believe that Google Glass is something that seems almost futuristic in terms of it&#39;s capabilities. To be able to use something like Glass...it would be, how shall I say...awesome!","url":"https://plus.google.com/109220350975156845997/posts/BmyyN7S8yy9","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z130ihizmmfqszhm023nzrbpyrmmdv3ju04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z130ihizmmfqszhm023nzrbpyrmmdv3ju04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z130ihizmmfqszhm023nzrbpyrmmdv3ju04/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
