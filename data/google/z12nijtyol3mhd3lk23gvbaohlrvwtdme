The documentary would potentially cover the following topics (however is not limited to): inefficiency and waste in litigation; homelessness in Reno, NV; arts, music, and creativity in Reno; night life in Reno ( all aspects... the drug addicts, the high class, the dives, the traveling minstrels, the gay bars, the college bars, the karaoke, the political/religious discussions). I&#39;d probably just take on all of these ideas simultaneously, haha. What do you say?  Would you like to give this aspiring journalist a glass? ;) <br /><br />It&#39;ll definitely make it easier to shoot rad videos of my son riding his bike on the Mendocino Coast.","url":"https://plus.google.com/108565490493226776527/posts/93mjztaZ9nd","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12nijtyol3mhd3lk23gvbaohlrvwtdme/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12nijtyol3mhd3lk23gvbaohlrvwtdme/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12nijtyol3mhd3lk23gvbaohlrvwtdme/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"video","displayName":"VID_20121123_131257.mp4","id":"108565490493226776527.5849360544819185442","content":"","url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/108565490493226776527/albums/5849360543292522065/5849360544819185442?authkey=CNfCm6mIlNXQwAE","image":{"url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-EbW3PH825vI/US0abJ0iByI/AAAAAAAAK2M/uagM_s04ED0/s0-d/VID_20121123_131257.mp4","type":"image/jpeg","height":1280,"width":720}}]},"provider":{"title":"Mobile"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
