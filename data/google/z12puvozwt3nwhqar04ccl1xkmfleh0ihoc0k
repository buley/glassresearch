The app might count pull-ups, push ups, squats, etc utilizing accelerometers and smart algorithms. Smartphones are not convenient to use at a gym, they require constant attention and distract from workout flow. Glass would be perfect to display relevant information and motivating and to compete with gym friends.","url":"https://plus.google.com/103962660955384161869/posts/d5UtcFx8FPp","replies":{"totalItems":2,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12puvozwt3nwhqar04ccl1xkmfleh0ihoc0k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12puvozwt3nwhqar04ccl1xkmfleh0ihoc0k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12puvozwt3nwhqar04ccl1xkmfleh0ihoc0k/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
