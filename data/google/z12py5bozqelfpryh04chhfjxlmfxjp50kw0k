Including visiting my sister in Louisville, one of my friends getting married in New Orleans, visiting my cousin in Austin for the first time in 20 years, then to Santa Fe to see my best friend from high school for the first time in 10 years, then up to the Grand Canyon, then to Vegas to hit the night life, then to LA to party with my many friends who have moved there and finally to San Francisco where I will park my bike and finally lay my head down in my new place.
