I am a amutuer film maker and writer and the ability to stream both processes on my eyes to my   friends and family that help me edit my work while being able to use both of my hands would be the most useful tool I could have (besides a word processor). My work could be done quicker and better which would be extremely beneficial. This is of course the main reason why I should be considered to receive the glasses, not including the other uses I would use it for like sports, directions, and video chatting. I didn&#39;t want to have to play this card but the competition looks tough so, my birthday is coming up in a few days and if I were to receive this as a gift, it&#39;d be my best birthday to date.","url":"https://plus.google.com/102439431318698837678/posts/fHrjWecLNTj","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z125hjtbxxaef1xr404chjlofpq0x34ote0/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z125hjtbxxaef1xr404chjlofpq0x34ote0/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z125hjtbxxaef1xr404chjlofpq0x34ote0/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
