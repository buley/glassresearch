It would be interesting to get a plan set of a home into Google Glass and allow framers (and later other subcontractors) to use that as the primary source of their building blueprints - wearing them UNDER their safety glasses. If we can develop a way to have them able to navigate a floor plan image or PDF, it may altogether eliminate the need for them to have printed plan sets while they frame a home. Also, they can easily check in with me (as architect) on questions they have during the framing. I would experiment first with just the framers.","url":"https://plus.google.com/112003273810890032622/posts/D5p3r2E8LNe","replies":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13hwhtp3nnpgzbmc23gylijepvoydk0n/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13hwhtp3nnpgzbmc23gylijepvoydk0n/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13hwhtp3nnpgzbmc23gylijepvoydk0n/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"Google Glass","content":"Have what it takes to be a Glass Explorer?
