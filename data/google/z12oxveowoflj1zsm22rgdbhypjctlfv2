I would also allow a feature where it would record constantly, but only save events for the previous say ten minutes, so as to capture events on tape that were not expected. and on top of voice commands, add a controller type device that could fit in a pocket, or possibly strapped onto a wrist. It should have an open app marketplace, so even things not thought of personally could be done. It should also have the ability to sync to someones face and give data on their mood based on their faces current position or heat signatures.","url":"https://plus.google.com/102053614005325537600/posts/4BKFvZeue4Q","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12oxveowoflj1zsm22rgdbhypjctlfv2/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12oxveowoflj1zsm22rgdbhypjctlfv2/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12oxveowoflj1zsm22rgdbhypjctlfv2/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
