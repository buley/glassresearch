I would also play guitar and play and make little cute live concerts to people who want to see me play a private session. Even read a book with it and send it to my little brother in Chile so he can see me read his favorite book: Cars. I know he would love this activity the most. ","url":"https://plus.google.com/116102328994061811803/posts/XeFV2HUocmY","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12lv1oyaomturahr04cjz35ayiecf2gbtc0k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12lv1oyaomturahr04cjz35ayiecf2gbtc0k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12lv1oyaomturahr04cjz35ayiecf2gbtc0k/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
