I would give Glass to Kate Pullinger for a day to use in the creation of a new literary work. <br /><br />Working live in a public location, Kate will draw from a pool of user-submitted ‘long-term memories’ (in text via the web) and &#39;short-term memories&#39; (moments captured using Glass) to create a new web-based multimedia story. Kate herself will also use Glass during the performance, providing an insider&#39;s view of the writer at work. <br /><br />The result will be a work that explores how we capture moments and how we remember them, while lifting the curtain on the creative process of turning memories into art.","url":"https://plus.google.com/117546185329674699879/posts/J72zkstqmoe","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13sxjpwyv2qcncfa23ddjh50vj4ixthe04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13sxjpwyv2qcncfa23ddjh50vj4ixthe04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13sxjpwyv2qcncfa23ddjh50vj4ixthe04/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"Memory Makes Us","content":"Writers and publishers labour under the implication that published words automatically become part of a wider cultural memory.
