But let me make a suggestion instead.<br /><br />There&#39;s a major concern with Glass: privacy. What&#39;s going to happen when everyone is &quot;on the record&quot; at all times?<br /><br />I propose the following partial solution: A &quot;Privacy Pin&quot;. A physical, discreet, but immediately recognizable pin, button or similar, that a privacy-concerned individual could wear, which would be recognized by Glass and cause it to blur the individual or stop recording entirely, possibly depending on the pin type.","url":"https://plus.google.com/115927134675809642331/posts/43FL99wq7md","replies":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13eitbxrn35fj5cm22ngboyxmzazrrak04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13eitbxrn35fj5cm22ngboyxmzazrrak04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13eitbxrn35fj5cm22ngboyxmzazrrak04/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"Google Glass","content":"Have what it takes to be a Glass Explorer?
