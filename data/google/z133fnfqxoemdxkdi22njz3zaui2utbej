As an aspiring music instructor, it would be amazing to record some of my own playing, from my perspective, and share it with students. One of the complaints I get is that they do not understand an example or demonstration since they are not able to see it from my perspective. Imagine the possibilities!<br /><br />Another way I would use it would be to test how Glass would work in a suburban environment. How would people react to the design and function to the device would definitely be an interesting approach to advertising and expansion of the concept.","url":"https://plus.google.com/116811699082368231427/posts/8nCiRtfGxNq","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z133fnfqxoemdxkdi22njz3zaui2utbej/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z133fnfqxoemdxkdi22njz3zaui2utbej/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z133fnfqxoemdxkdi22njz3zaui2utbej/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
