It requires that everything is done correctly and that we have access to the current information. This would allow me to create learning videos and scenarios that can make a more efficient workforce. This can also be utilized to contact a coworker to solve a problem immediately. By creating a connected workforce I can advance the effectiveness of each of my employees.","url":"https://plus.google.com/104994366503090972252/posts/XfqWpLm8UcN","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z133urqzkmyfebfpr04chhagmnnfilwh2ck/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z133urqzkmyfebfpr04chhagmnnfilwh2ck/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z133urqzkmyfebfpr04chhagmnnfilwh2ck/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
