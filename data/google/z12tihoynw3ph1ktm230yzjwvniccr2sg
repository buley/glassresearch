What a wonderful way to show and teach my students what conducting a band/orchestra looks like from my perspective! Google glass would also be an incredible teaching tool for future educators by showing them examples of classroom activities from the perspective of a master teacher. The possibilities for the use of Google Glass in education is very exciting! I would love to use this in my own teaching!","url":"https://plus.google.com/113000501622984606157/posts/9TBw6gNbcv5","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12tihoynw3ph1ktm230yzjwvniccr2sg/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":2,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12tihoynw3ph1ktm230yzjwvniccr2sg/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12tihoynw3ph1ktm230yzjwvniccr2sg/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"photo","id":"113000501622984606157.5849358488014767010","content":"music_masters2.jpg","url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/113000501622984606157/albums/5849358480853529585/5849358488014767010?authkey=CLb9lt_IorekhAE","image":{"url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-OhvsPuqiinw/US0YjboJQ6I/AAAAAAAAARQ/0exSflLAv7c/w497-h373/music_masters2.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","height":373,"width":497},"fullImage":{"url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-OhvsPuqiinw/US0YjboJQ6I/AAAAAAAAARQ/0exSflLAv7c/music_masters2.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","height":714,"width":1611}}]},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
