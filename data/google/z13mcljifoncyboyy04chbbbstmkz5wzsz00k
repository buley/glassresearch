Vlogging is the new thing now and I can&#39;t help but think Glass will help youtube channels exponentially. It would definitely help me get my own channel off the ground for sure. Being a fighter, I&#39;d love to train a few times and give people the first person perspective of what it&#39;s like to go through a genuine boxing routine - a  real day in the life of a fighter during camp, from their view. That would be awesome too. I guess I&#39;d just capture parts of my days for subscribers to see, as I would (and currently do) with a far-less-as-cool camera, and further maximize my video editing potential as well as show fight fans a thing or two about &#39;really&#39; stepping into a gym.","url":"https://plus.google.com/111232239870923776843/posts/eF2cKSUgtu9","replies":{"totalItems":2,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13mcljifoncyboyy04chbbbstmkz5wzsz00k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13mcljifoncyboyy04chbbbstmkz5wzsz00k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13mcljifoncyboyy04chbbbstmkz5wzsz00k/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
