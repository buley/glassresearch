Also see how people live outside modern community. I would help whoever i can as many people need not the money - just a helping hand, maybe a good advice or just company. You never know who can you help and how.<br />Through google glass i could share this experience with whole world, as they could interact, give me tips, maybe some helping hand. People sitting at home could help people from different countries through me. Eventually maybe more people could start their journey like that to make world a better place :)","url":"https://plus.google.com/103421599154107954313/posts/P1DM5KCEEs9","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12ohtu4yummgnlo304cjdib4qfij55acik/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12ohtu4yummgnlo304cjdib4qfij55acik/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12ohtu4yummgnlo304cjdib4qfij55acik/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"Google Glass","content":"Have what it takes to be a Glass Explorer?
