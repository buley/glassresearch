If I had glass, I would use them as I take scenic rides all over the United States this season. And I think that it would very cool to be able to sent actual footage as I am traveling and share with my friends. It would also be cool to incorporate that video footage into a new dvd for my club.","url":"https://plus.google.com/118037398552712572935/posts/WEZmSbvVftE","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12lzxtalq3jgnsxi04cfpsavorkxbnjef0/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12lzxtalq3jgnsxi04cfpsavorkxbnjef0/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12lzxtalq3jgnsxi04cfpsavorkxbnjef0/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Mobile"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
