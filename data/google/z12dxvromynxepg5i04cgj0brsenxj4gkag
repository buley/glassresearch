Race your ghost or other users and see it all in the heads up display. All the information you wanted without having to pull out your phone or look down at your bike computer. Get turn by turn navigation, weather information and nearby points of interest while riding / running. Upload your own maps / routes or use one created and uploaded by other users. I want to change the way information is presented to you on a bike or run and Google Glass is the perfect way to do it.","url":"https://plus.google.com/107161039968403628380/posts/WAgX8Aq1z1p","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12dxvromynxepg5i04cgj0brsenxj4gkag/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12dxvromynxepg5i04cgj0brsenxj4gkag/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12dxvromynxepg5i04cgj0brsenxj4gkag/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
