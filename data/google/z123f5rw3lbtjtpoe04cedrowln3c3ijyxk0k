Mind you I&#39;ve been wearing them for 35 years, so I&#39;m used to it. I&#39;ve used contacts in the past, but can&#39;t be bothered now.<br /><br />I do love the idea of a heads up display and access to information any time, but do I really need it? I don&#39;t generally use mobile data as it is and don&#39;t miss it. I get enough info when I&#39;m at the computers.<br /><br />So, want...yes, need...no.","url":"https://plus.google.com/100341069332851031995/posts/QCNALgCXyhP","replies":{"totalItems":2,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z123f5rw3lbtjtpoe04cedrowln3c3ijyxk0k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z123f5rw3lbtjtpoe04cedrowln3c3ijyxk0k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z123f5rw3lbtjtpoe04cedrowln3c3ijyxk0k/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
