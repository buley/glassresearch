I could give guided tours of my favorite fishing spots.  Snap wildlife pictures on the fly without having to get out a camera and losing the shot. Or I could make use of a disc golf course gps that shows pin location and distance.  This is just recreational use though, because with technology like this, the bigger upswing will be using this in the professional environment.  I could make training videos for my employees from a 1st person point of view.  I could make a video of me fixing something on my vehicle and when someone watches it, they&#39;ll know EXACTLY which screw to remove while fixing their own.  All in all, <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23ifihadglass\">#ifihadglass</a> the world would be a much more amazing place!","url":"https://plus.google.com/109266202656990242340/posts/Pu2KuZpYS75","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12qeb3jxy3ntdwoc04cj1pyfpaujxdifq40k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12qeb3jxy3ntdwoc04cj1pyfpaujxdifq40k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12qeb3jxy3ntdwoc04cj1pyfpaujxdifq40k/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
