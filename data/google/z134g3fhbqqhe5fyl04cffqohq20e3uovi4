GIS and land navigation applications, search segment boundaries, waypoints, compass tools; GIS integrated clue awareness for searchers, real time clue imagery from the searcher to IC; team positions and search area tracks; real time video for the Incident Commander, with location and bearing information - this would allow IC to have a greater situational awareness and build the search strategy with greater effectiveness. The ways this technology can aid SAR are vast.","url":"https://plus.google.com/116096775133950183698/posts/c29NDMkLHSw","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z134g3fhbqqhe5fyl04cffqohq20e3uovi4/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z134g3fhbqqhe5fyl04cffqohq20e3uovi4/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z134g3fhbqqhe5fyl04cffqohq20e3uovi4/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
