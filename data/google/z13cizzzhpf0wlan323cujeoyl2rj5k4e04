If I Had Glass, when I am out walking, or working on something, I could dictate or record whatever inspiration strikes in the moment it happens. If I had Glass, I could get my books finished faster, share them sooner, and spend time writing with my voice, because sometimes that&#39;s just the way the story flows fastest :D<br /><br />Edit: So, I couldn&#39;t figure out how to link my instant upload photos of the Snowmen we made today outside in the glorious snow, So, the pictures are publicly shared on my profile, directly above this post :D﻿","url":"https://plus.google.com/103143888699119439557/posts/HbSNoFHA8as","replies":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13cizzzhpf0wlan323cujeoyl2rj5k4e04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13cizzzhpf0wlan323cujeoyl2rj5k4e04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13cizzzhpf0wlan323cujeoyl2rj5k4e04/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
