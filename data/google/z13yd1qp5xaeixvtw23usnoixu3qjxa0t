Some<br />steps in the script would be actions to be performed. Others would review results so far and loop back to repeat actions if necessary. Questions<br />could be answered to lead down different paths through the script. Photos and videos could be captured to document the results.","url":"https://plus.google.com/117556309279090076649/posts/BBZ5wf8ncps","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13yd1qp5xaeixvtw23usnoixu3qjxa0t/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13yd1qp5xaeixvtw23usnoixu3qjxa0t/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13yd1qp5xaeixvtw23usnoixu3qjxa0t/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
