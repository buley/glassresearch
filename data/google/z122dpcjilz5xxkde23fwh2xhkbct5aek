I am a amutuer film maker and writer and the ability to stream both processes on my eyes to my Â  friends and family that help me edit my work while being able to use both of my hands would be the most useful tool I could have (besides a word processor). My work could be done quicker and better which would be extremely beneficial. This is of course the main reason why I should be considered to receive the glasses, not including the other uses I would use it for like sports, directions, and video chatting. I didn&#39;t want to have to play this card but the competition looks tough so, my birthday is coming up in a few days and if I were to receive this as a gift, it&#39;d be my best birthday to date.","url":"https://plus.google.com/102439431318698837678/posts/87SETbmQnmZ","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z122dpcjilz5xxkde23fwh2xhkbct5aek/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z122dpcjilz5xxkde23fwh2xhkbct5aek/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z122dpcjilz5xxkde23fwh2xhkbct5aek/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
