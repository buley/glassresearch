This was on Facebook, last Spring when I had my Lasik. Now, If I had glass, I would, as a new mom-to-be, document my little one&#39;s journey every single moment. But, honestly, I do not wish to overload my life with any more electronic gadgets. I want to see if Glass gives me a new perspective on living a high-tech yet hassle-free life. And inspires me.","url":"https://plus.google.com/104541509550125089534/posts/FAtntp4Zxjd","replies":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12hsnqz0qmrwxbt322ktjuqaqeuxxfxv04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12hsnqz0qmrwxbt322ktjuqaqeuxxfxv04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12hsnqz0qmrwxbt322ktjuqaqeuxxfxv04/people/resharers"}},"annotation":"Congrats!!!
