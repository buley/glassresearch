I would be able to teach people how to play instruments such as guitar and piano,  in point-of-view videos. This would help someone understand the instrument in an easier fashion, rather than having him/her watch from an angle and try to replicate. I would also like to take videos live from concerts, and be able to show the world what I see when I perform. This would truly make for interesting and innovative content! Thank you for your consideration! ","url":"https://plus.google.com/106820730982184303759/posts/E8r1PWjeGSZ","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13rhvn4hmfvzdkui23cyt5qov22gnke0/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13rhvn4hmfvzdkui23cyt5qov22gnke0/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13rhvn4hmfvzdkui23cyt5qov22gnke0/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
