The students work in pairs and I circulate around the room helping them as they get stuck. They are generally building from blueprints. When they get stuck, it is often because they have one piece not quite in the right place. I would love to be able to digitize the building instructions so that Google Glass knows what the model <b>should</b> look like and then when I look at students&#39; work, it could highlight in my vision which piece is out of place. It would save me a lot of time counting studs and technic holes, allowing me to move between the groups faster (I have 20+ students in the class).","url":"https://plus.google.com/116077417321878358008/posts/GdW7N8ADt1S","replies":{"totalItems":2,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13et14a1maugfi2x22bxffbhkrrzfyrh04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":13,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13et14a1maugfi2x22bxffbhkrrzfyrh04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13et14a1maugfi2x22bxffbhkrrzfyrh04/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"photo","id":"116077417321878358008.5849724520347316162","content":"LEGO Google Glass.png","url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/116077417321878358008/albums/5849724515586581361/5849724520347316162?authkey=CO_cjc2FtZnNBQ","image":{"url":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-y0z9M1p27ZY/US5ldUUxr8I/AAAAAAAAClM/SEJwiE_m9_s/w497-h373/LEGO%2BGoogle%2BGlass.png","type":"image/jpeg","height":373,"width":497},"fullImage":{"url":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-y0z9M1p27ZY/US5ldUUxr8I/AAAAAAAAClM/SEJwiE_m9_s/LEGO%2BGoogle%2BGlass.png","type":"image/jpeg","height":1405,"width":2048}}]},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
