As users take photos of known landmarks, they can be easily uploaded to Google Maps and used to create 3D composite images of landmarks and locations. Google Maps software would interpolate to create 3D models of buildings, landmarks and landscapes, which would be overlaid onto Google Maps.","url":"https://plus.google.com/106695486501794642092/posts/6nMWFCR2bQr","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12vwzxzwnqehrm12235w1fq4uflyzuk5/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12vwzxzwnqehrm12235w1fq4uflyzuk5/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12vwzxzwnqehrm12235w1fq4uflyzuk5/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
