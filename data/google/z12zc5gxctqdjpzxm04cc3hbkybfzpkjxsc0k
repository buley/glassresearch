I will use the 21 century technology to walk you around in the most ancient living city which was built more than 3000 years ago but still LIVING. The tour will be during the day time and night time. During the tour you will be able to see the inside and outside of old houses , shops, and restaurants. The tour will include the daily routines and rituals of a typical Yemeni family through out the whole day. All that will be done in OLD SANA&#39;A which considered the most ancient living city in the whole world.","url":"https://plus.google.com/110328948475032990529/posts/WwXCq7JxXr5","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12zc5gxctqdjpzxm04cc3hbkybfzpkjxsc0k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":2,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12zc5gxctqdjpzxm04cc3hbkybfzpkjxsc0k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12zc5gxctqdjpzxm04cc3hbkybfzpkjxsc0k/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"Google Glass","content":"Have what it takes to be a Glass Explorer?
