And how, wherever I go, I am an automatic ambassador. Because while the myth and the glamour of America may rise and fall in their eyes, how people feel about the United States as a whole is based on the empathy and understanding of each individual citizen they meet.<br /><br />With Glass, I could go into any global city and say hello in the local language. No tourist camera would block my view of the neighborhood. I would never get lost, either physically or metaphorically.<br /><br />Google Glass is living proof of American ingenuity and imagination. It is a symbol of what the United States has always stood for in the dreams of other nations. Let me take it on tour and make people see us in a new way.","url":"https://plus.google.com/103124759658982648787/posts/1h53rUyQhMw","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12fdfri4uu4hl40423lhz5bjyr0c53km/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":3,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12fdfri4uu4hl40423lhz5bjyr0c53km/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12fdfri4uu4hl40423lhz5bjyr0c53km/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"photo","id":"103124759658982648787.5849806006961088674","content":"IfIHadGlass_stream.jpeg","url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/103124759658982648787/albums/5849806006519088657/5849806006961088674?authkey=CKPt3oLV9_aUcA","image":{"url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-AX79oGyzsrQ/US6vkdncqKI/AAAAAAAAAjM/K0GMgVMz4pY/w497-h373/IfIHadGlass_stream.jpeg","type":"image/jpeg","height":373,"width":497},"fullImage":{"url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-AX79oGyzsrQ/US6vkdncqKI/AAAAAAAAAjM/K0GMgVMz4pY/IfIHadGlass_stream.jpeg","type":"image/jpeg","height":546,"width":649}}]},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
