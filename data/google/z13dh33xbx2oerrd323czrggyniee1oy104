I could ask for them and glass could take me to them.<br /><br />I like the 30 second time lapse idea so I could rewind something in real life to experience it again.  <br /><br />Translation of foreign signs, books menus on the fly. <br /><br />An app that links to facebook, g+, linkedin, twitter etc and identifies people&#39;s faces in the street and in crowds and notifies you that it&#39;s seen someone you know, point them out. <br /><br />A person identifier. <br /><br />A smartphone is starting to feel quite clunky.
