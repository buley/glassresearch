The view obtained from the dentist  is a very unique view when performing a procedure as the dentist has the best view to capture all the information. With the ability to capture real time videos and pictures with the permission of the patient and all those involved, this information could then be instantly streamed to other students and specialists who are unable to be present at the time of the surgery. If the streaming option is not available, the procedure could be recorded and then used as a case presentation later that day. If the device has the ability to zoom in, this would be even better! Most importantly, working in a rural and remote community where there is an absence of specialists to consult with, in the event of a dental emergency that requires a specialist consult,  this real time video capture from the dentist&#39;s perspective could then be streamed to specialists in city based communities who could then talk the rural dentist through the procedure as the specialist is able to see exactly what the rural dentist sees on the other end. Please send me a pair of your finest glasses so we can experiment with this technology. The sky&#39;s the limit......better said, with a strong enough imagination, there is no limit","url":"https://plus.google.com/108336774769949499193/posts/J4m44vdbSeu","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z125hhwgtwyucj0va23ghrbhqrnbfxsyr04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z125hhwgtwyucj0va23ghrbhqrnbfxsyr04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z125hhwgtwyucj0va23ghrbhqrnbfxsyr04/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
