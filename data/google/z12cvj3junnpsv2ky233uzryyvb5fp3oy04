To chat more often with those I know serving in the US Military overseas. I would also use the incredible features of it to record and photograph vacations and share them with my loved ones. Essentially, I would use Glass to ensure those who are close to me will always feel close to me.","url":"https://plus.google.com/114921292152895050384/posts/62ocbHQAZQ4","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12cvj3junnpsv2ky233uzryyvb5fp3oy04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12cvj3junnpsv2ky233uzryyvb5fp3oy04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12cvj3junnpsv2ky233uzryyvb5fp3oy04/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
