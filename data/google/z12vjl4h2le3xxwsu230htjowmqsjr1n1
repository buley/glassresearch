When something as new and innovative like Google Glass comes out, I often hear much ridicule from my family and friends about why its not necessary or how its a &quot;dumb idea&quot; and I love to be the person to show them how useful a product like this really can be. That, and I really want a pair of these amazing glasses!","url":"https://plus.google.com/108760791925646420897/posts/5W1FEJcFz9b","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12vjl4h2le3xxwsu230htjowmqsjr1n1/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12vjl4h2le3xxwsu230htjowmqsjr1n1/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12vjl4h2le3xxwsu230htjowmqsjr1n1/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
