When you ask for a show of hands, let Glass see/scan the # of hands in the air, and give you actual data (what % of audience had hands raised, for instance). Could be fun. (Really amazing would be to have audience members vote by holding up a number, then let Glass analyze the pic and give you feedback: 20% voted #1, 10% voted #2, 40% voted #3, etc.)<br /><br />Not saying it&#39;s the most earth-shattering idea, just think it would be a fun way to make a presentation much more interactive.","url":"https://plus.google.com/112339769006469685593/posts/4CKqCYFTBcs","replies":{"totalItems":2,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12gcbya0yeotp3cn221wnah4wjlzvagk04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":7,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12gcbya0yeotp3cn221wnah4wjlzvagk04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12gcbya0yeotp3cn221wnah4wjlzvagk04/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
