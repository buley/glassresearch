I only need an idea of their location (eg a town). With that information, i just need to enter the thouthands of free and moovable face-to-face observation cameras near that location, to have a full look around. That helps me to do my work more silently and faster with less staff (two persons for two hours instead of 30 searching a whole day). I would be exited.","url":"https://plus.google.com/107447339119914359944/posts/gs83pFeMJA4","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13ky1syplnqgberi04cf3wacmjteh3an0k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13ky1syplnqgberi04cf3wacmjteh3an0k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13ky1syplnqgberi04cf3wacmjteh3an0k/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
