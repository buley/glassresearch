People see tennis as a passive sport but its full of intense moments. I would love to also show my self playing basketball with my school team, we aren&#39;t super great but we all have fun and play hard. I would use them to film and take pictures for photography class. I would love to get a pair of glasses and even if I don&#39;t I&#39;m going to save up to get some on day 1! Great idea, amazing project, hope these will change the way we see the world.","url":"https://plus.google.com/106962083825683196270/posts/58s4wpwdkE7","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13mh1wadrm0yhr0s23kilqj1s2uzrv2b/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13mh1wadrm0yhr0s23kilqj1s2uzrv2b/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13mh1wadrm0yhr0s23kilqj1s2uzrv2b/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
