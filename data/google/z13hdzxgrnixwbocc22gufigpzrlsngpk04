As a horseback rider, many people do not understand the excruciating work we put in to our sport, instead they think of it as a joke. We spend many of our days waking up early, working with the horses, and then competing. We also work out to maintain shape. My sport is one of the most difficult and unique sports on the planet. Horses don&#39;t do all the work like many people say, instead it is more of a team between rider and campion, both competing for the win. If I had glass, I would use it to expose the world to what horseback riding really is. ","url":"https://plus.google.com/103965230910185656021/posts/2SnmLMZKe3b","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13hdzxgrnixwbocc22gufigpzrlsngpk04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13hdzxgrnixwbocc22gufigpzrlsngpk04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13hdzxgrnixwbocc22gufigpzrlsngpk04/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"album","displayName":"","id":"103965230910185656021.5849535960771049825","url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/103965230910185656021/albums/5849535960771049825?authkey=CMjX9ozxoK63pwE","thumbnails":[{"url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/103965230910185656021/albums/5849535960771049825/5849535959075081378?authkey=CMjX9ozxoK63pwE","description":"","image":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4PapBT8yRXg/US259m2LTKI/AAAAAAAAABc/mIFE6avz2gc/w497-h373/167311_487656498476_3599726_n.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","height":373,"width":497}},{"url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/103965230910185656021/albums/5849535960771049825/5849536001084222210?authkey=CMjX9ozxoK63pwE","description":"","image":{"url":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-tYnPf8aSXOw/US26ADV76wI/AAAAAAAAABk/DTJrjdFpJic/w78-h78-p/71835_10151312009718477_1646238493_n.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","height":78,"width":78}},{"url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/103965230910185656021/albums/5849535960771049825/5849536049055795906?authkey=CMjX9ozxoK63pwE","description":"","image":{"url":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-QOsKUvqrYUE/US26C2DQCsI/AAAAAAAAABs/-PbKUEU2z9Y/w78-h78-p/247493_10150188498923477_3773592_n.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","height":78,"width":78}},{"url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/103965230910185656021/albums/5849535960771049825/5849536233954177570?authkey=CMjX9ozxoK63pwE","description":"","image":{"url":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-RKJDsy1Nqu4/US26Nm2dciI/AAAAAAAAACA/6f6tCYQf7eI/w78-h78-p/522849_10150801234378477_1297309072_n.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","height":78,"width":78}},{"url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/103965230910185656021/albums/5849535960771049825/5849536402605831762?authkey=CMjX9ozxoK63pwE","description":"","image":{"url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-PTFYlp_pkYY/US26XbIJdlI/AAAAAAAAACU/Z9TaKq7NeHI/w78-h78-p/406113_10151114186747275_1505840693_n.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","height":78,"width":78}}]}]},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
