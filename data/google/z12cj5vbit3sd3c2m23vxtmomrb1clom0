I&#39;m a software engineer at a Fitness company and would love to play around with a Glass. Running on a treadmill is kind of boring so I would like to find other form of entertainment that could be done with Glass while exercising on an equipment such as reading news/feeds, watching videos, chatting with friends, or playing games.","url":"https://plus.google.com/106083615526316597785/posts/EkwSWVaHtcf","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12cj5vbit3sd3c2m23vxtmomrb1clom0/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12cj5vbit3sd3c2m23vxtmomrb1clom0/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12cj5vbit3sd3c2m23vxtmomrb1clom0/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"Google Glass","content":"Have what it takes to be a Glass Explorer?
