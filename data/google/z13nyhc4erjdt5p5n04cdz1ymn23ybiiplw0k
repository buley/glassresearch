As a graphic artist Id also be able to take pictures of all my projects easily and send updates to teachers or fellow group members. If I had glass, school would be fun again. ","url":"https://plus.google.com/118369558563111551750/posts/X3uJNZq2vJr","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13nyhc4erjdt5p5n04cdz1ymn23ybiiplw0k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13nyhc4erjdt5p5n04cdz1ymn23ybiiplw0k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13nyhc4erjdt5p5n04cdz1ymn23ybiiplw0k/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
