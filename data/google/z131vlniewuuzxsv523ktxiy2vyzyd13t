I&#39;m an aspiring games developer, using glass would help me record what I had seen and done as inspiration for future game ideas. I&#39;d also like visit some famous game studios. So video calling a friends &amp; family who have the same passion for games as I walk into a studio would be awesome. Would also make them very jealous.     ","url":"https://plus.google.com/104314495848558649443/posts/J2QUN6j9PQv","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z131vlniewuuzxsv523ktxiy2vyzyd13t/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z131vlniewuuzxsv523ktxiy2vyzyd13t/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z131vlniewuuzxsv523ktxiy2vyzyd13t/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
