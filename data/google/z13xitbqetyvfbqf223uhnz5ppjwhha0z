The information along the way would be helpful (flights, directions, etc). And it would give me an opportunity to more easily share what life is like there. Most of Haiti doesn&#39;t have electricity. Most Haitians are unemployed. The poverty there is extreme, but they are such a beautiful people and they deserve a voice.<br /><br />Haiti is only a couple hours away from Florida, but it&#39;s a completely different world. <br /><br />However, I&#39;d never pay 1500 dollars for the experience. Not when our neighbours are dying of starvation,  dirty water, and preventable diseases that we haven&#39;t seen in over a hundred years.  Not when their children are slaves, known as <i>restaveks</i>. <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23perspective\">#perspective</a><br /><br />This child is a beautiful little Rose.
