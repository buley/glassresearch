I&#39;m leaving from Italy, the country i live in the next september and i will go to Canada for at least a couple months. There i will look for a job and when i will have enough money to pay myself another trip, i will use them to reach the USA. There i will try to do the same thing to reach Brazil, then Australia, Japan, China, Russia, Dubai, Istanbul, Germany, Sweden, Iceland and UK.<br /><br />My journey should last a couple years and i would love to record all this life-changing experience.Â ","url":"https://plus.google.com/107693429226194438832/posts/UGWGQzAGonH","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z121ibxbpliwx50p304cefoakyyxj33gmmg0k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z121ibxbpliwx50p304cefoakyyxj33gmmg0k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z121ibxbpliwx50p304cefoakyyxj33gmmg0k/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
