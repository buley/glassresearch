All quality control concerns could be viewed live from my glass in the field by contractors, architects, and engineers as if they were looking at the issues with their own eyes. This ease would be able to diagnose and collaborate on unforeseen issues immediately saving countless hours and dollars in travel, and project delivery. With Glass, one eye could see for one hundred. ","url":"https://plus.google.com/104211900256033185982/posts/bHNSdodsbAB","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12qjdfbpqejj5yqg04cghwzqnvhi3syg44/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12qjdfbpqejj5yqg04cghwzqnvhi3syg44/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12qjdfbpqejj5yqg04cghwzqnvhi3syg44/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
