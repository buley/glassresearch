I originally started my exploration in all this when i decided to try and travel by foot through out many places. I wanted to post footage of my journeys on social networks, yet needed a reliable portable way of doing so. I didn&#39;t have a head cam, so id run around with a webcam on my goggles, and a laptop on my back. I still do this now, yet most recently chose to continue even when my funds were a little higher. I liked the creative control, and begin using it for many of my other projects as well.  I learned how to remote control my computer while its recording so i could adjust the camera perfectly even if it was out of my direct vision,and I could also use this to take snapshots (this helped me try some cool stop motion animations techniques as well). I started beginning to do things that even if i had the money could not find obviously in certain gadgets. I tend to search all the time new ways to simplify my stuff, possibly finding new technology that incorporates what i need. Most of the time they do not exist, so i was amazed when i saw the presentation for Google glass months ago. My computer became my hub to connect all my experiments, so when I found something that configured what i was doing all in one,  I instantly thought, &quot;they understand me&quot;! I wouldn&#39;t have to carry my laptop full of wires all over, i could actually run(considering I have tried doing action videos) plus all its abilities that I never even thought of would broaden the horizon ten fold! I would be honored, humbled, and privileged to be able to get my hands on this. ","url":"https://plus.google.com/115677978327527841284/posts/fQaLoGjwBJ3","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12uhfphprnqc1nz504cjhy4smyvspgr4ck/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12uhfphprnqc1nz504cjhy4smyvspgr4ck/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12uhfphprnqc1nz504cjhy4smyvspgr4ck/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"video","displayName":"head cam voyage","content":"I created this video with the YouTube Video Editor (http://www.youtube.com/editor)","url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ateqYYNRUpM","image":{"url":"https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://i2.ytimg.com/vi/ateqYYNRUpM/hqdefault.jpg&container=focus&gadget=a&rewriteMime=image/*&refresh=31536000&resize_w=497","type":"image/jpeg","height":279,"width":497},"embed":{"url":"http://www.youtube.com/v/ateqYYNRUpM?list=UUVuhggRyiScsFP7nqcWxmUg&version=3","type":"application/x-shockwave-flash"}}]},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
