I&#39;ll never get my Glass with just +2!!<br /><br />How many times have you pulled up to a spot and thought it was close, gave it a try and wasted time trying to fit into a space that turned out to be too small?<br /><br />With Google Glass™, launch the parallel parking app, look at the car&#39;s bumper in front of the space, then look at the other car&#39;s bumper behind the space and, voila! Red light, yellow light, or green light based on the size of your car and the tolerances you set for your skill level.<br /><br />In fact, launch the app as you&#39;re trolling for a parking space and it will green light when there&#39;s a spot for you!<br /><br />Seriously, what do I do now?<br /><br />Dear Google, <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23CanIhazGlass\">#CanIhazGlass</a> and make this happen?<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Guy Burdick, person with a pretty cool Glass™ app for help with parallel parking","url":"https://plus.google.com/113414118636069419478/posts/hTF85bwwZiv","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12bwzkanyzqhxvbl04ccz5yzzabi1spn5c/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12bwzkanyzqhxvbl04ccz5yzzabi1spn5c/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12bwzkanyzqhxvbl04ccz5yzzabi1spn5c/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
