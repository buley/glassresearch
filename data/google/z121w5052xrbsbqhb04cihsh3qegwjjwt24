An example is to integrate the google glasses into a MRP system to look up the expected deliveries from a UPS truck, acknowledge the deliveries as the get off the truck. Another example would be a mission support personnel on the flight deck to ensure that an aircraft is ready for a mission.Â ","url":"https://plus.google.com/109460330112203360183/posts/V3rh5PWA4Rp","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z121w5052xrbsbqhb04cihsh3qegwjjwt24/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z121w5052xrbsbqhb04cihsh3qegwjjwt24/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z121w5052xrbsbqhb04cihsh3qegwjjwt24/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
