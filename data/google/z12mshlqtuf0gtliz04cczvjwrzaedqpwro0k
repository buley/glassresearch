I&#39;d get to show them all this exciting California stuff that they&#39;ve never seen, and may never see. On top of sharing my life with them and never loosing touch, I&#39;d also have a simple, intuitive way to keep myself on track by using directions since I&#39;m new out here, the calendar to keep myself on top of this new business, and all of the great features that google glasses would provide for me. Plus, it&#39;d be much more fun than a smartphone.
