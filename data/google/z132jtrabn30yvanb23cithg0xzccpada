Document every corner of the next generation and try to push glass to its limits to ensure future success. As a 20 year old I would help spread awareness between generations and use it to stay in touch with friends and family. As a college runner I would film a race to capture the intricacies of running and show off the natural beauty that often accompanies a distance run. If I had glass I would hope to accomplish all that is possible and reach a new world of technological integration.","url":"https://plus.google.com/106976939184472787553/posts/JGGLYvnXZ4w","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z132jtrabn30yvanb23cithg0xzccpada/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z132jtrabn30yvanb23cithg0xzccpada/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z132jtrabn30yvanb23cithg0xzccpada/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Mobile"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
