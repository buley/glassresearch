Being far away from my family for school can be tough and emotionally draining, but this way they could get a first-person view of the city and see what I&#39;m doing in school. Plus, with me transferring schools in the fall, they can get a good look at the new campus they haven&#39;t seen yet and explore with me when I go out on adventures! When I miss holidays they can all see what THEY&#39;RE missing by not coming to visit me!","url":"https://plus.google.com/112931748085678466439/posts/icy3PTUjha2","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12hvheoqnbfudurs04ccjm5jpyey3rqtso0k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12hvheoqnbfudurs04ccjm5jpyey3rqtso0k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12hvheoqnbfudurs04ccjm5jpyey3rqtso0k/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
