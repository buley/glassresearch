We&#39;re already doing it with deeply educational AR exhibits @augmentedzoo. <br /><br />We&#39;d help push Glass forward with our amazing AR content and deeply passionate team who really understand how to educate people in the 21st century. <br /><br />Imagine walking through a museum and seeing dinosaur skeletons come to life! How they moved, what their skin and feathers looked like, etc. Wait, we&#39;re doing that too! <a href=\"http://bit.ly/XC2YqE\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bit.ly/XC2YqE</a><br /><br />Let us buy Glass!
