I&#39;d like to reflect on how i impact young students as i begin to teach Education Technology. Whats it like to see through my eyes? Am i remembering it the way i see it? Would love to examine the meditation and yoga practice using Glass and everyday travel, from playing in the park with my yorkie to traveling on the NYC subway! Overall, i just wanna be among the first to say i have glass and it&#39;s AWESOME!!! ;-) ","url":"https://plus.google.com/101643079847036376443/posts/Jd9WrbTdUkE","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13fsjkamnnmv1fnd223ffsyjkr3uzc4s04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13fsjkamnnmv1fnd223ffsyjkr3uzc4s04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13fsjkamnnmv1fnd223ffsyjkr3uzc4s04/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"Google Glass","content":"Have what it takes to be a Glass Explorer?
