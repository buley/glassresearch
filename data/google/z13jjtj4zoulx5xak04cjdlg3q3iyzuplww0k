I would use it to remember America, where random conversations lead to inspirational ideas, where we are drowned in creativity and boundless possibilities abound so that when I return to India, and the mountains of petty corruption, bureaucracy and inefficiency loom before me I can reinvigorate my creative spirits by &quot;looking back&quot; and reliving the time when everything was possible. I will use glass to expose India, the daily clashes with the uncaring bureaucracy which causes so much pain and difficulty to millions of Indians with the hope that exposure causes awareness which leads to shame and change. .
