From Downtown to Tinseltown from the colorful barrios of East LA to the hidden coves of Malibu, I am there and I want to you show you how we are all connected, its easy to forget in a town like LA.  I ride on the metro after chasing buses and when I finally get the opportunity to meet someone with a story that compelles me, that floor me and move me and shake me or I often find myself helping someone discover the googlemaps feature on their phone when they need directions either because they have pulled over to ask or beccause they have been waiting for the bus for too long, the expression on their face is priceless.  <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23ifihadglass\">#ifihadglass</a> You could come along for the ride, the walks, the sunsets, the vinyasa flows,the jogs and all the beautiful colorful people that make the beating heart of LA.","url":"https://plus.google.com/102429555329201817139/posts/hoMuJnUFmxQ","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13yyvlzyr2qdfxrn04cdhxihkjqshubjqs0k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13yyvlzyr2qdfxrn04cdhxihkjqshubjqs0k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13yyvlzyr2qdfxrn04cdhxihkjqshubjqs0k/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"Google Glass","content":"Have what it takes to be a Glass Explorer?
