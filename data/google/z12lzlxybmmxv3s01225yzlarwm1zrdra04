It would bring us closer together whilst we&#39;re apart from one-another. Something only technology can do these days. They&#39;d also collect all the memories for me that i&#39;ll someday treasure because as with all adventures I&#39;ll have to finish this one someday.<br /><br />Glass will get our faces away from our screens and locked back onto people&#39;s faces. Unobtrusive technology accompanying us side by side into a shining new future.<br /><br />Thank you google.","url":"https://plus.google.com/114996081228881874396/posts/1J1NoEzw114","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12lzlxybmmxv3s01225yzlarwm1zrdra04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12lzlxybmmxv3s01225yzlarwm1zrdra04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12lzlxybmmxv3s01225yzlarwm1zrdra04/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
