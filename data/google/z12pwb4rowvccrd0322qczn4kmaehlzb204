In a couple of years we can install a camera that focus on our eyes detecting what kind of emotions we are having at that moment and give information related to what we feel at that moment. As well we can introduce a bracelet named Google Health, a device that can get information of our bodies. It will help older people that might have a heart attack or any other accident while driving, Google health connected to Google Glass can predict heart rate among many others and know how the person feels.
