I love talking with people and learning about them. I love talking with people to see how I can help them. But, ever since I became hard of hearing in 2000, it is so very difficult to understand what people are saying to me. I miss out on so much now and I think that tying in the live-captioning capabilities of Google Translate, Google Voice, or YouTube would help me to communicate with the world again.","url":"https://plus.google.com/101281168324525475412/posts/UqNn9YzhaBo","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z133fnmj2qbbeth5a04cepcaiwfug5jat1o/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z133fnmj2qbbeth5a04cepcaiwfug5jat1o/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z133fnmj2qbbeth5a04cepcaiwfug5jat1o/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
