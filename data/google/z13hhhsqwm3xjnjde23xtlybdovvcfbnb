More specifically, I am totally blind in one eye, and half blind in the other. I would like to use an overlay on the small field of vision that does work, and include exciting accessibility features such as the ability to &#39;broaden&#39; my peripheral vision through edge flashing or fish-eyeing a video overlay. Further, I would like to experiment with potential uses of the technology in ocular physical therapy, image magnification, and collision detection/warning.<br /><br />Oh, and of course I also want to play with all the built-in goodies and Googleness.","url":"https://plus.google.com/110342319077312937603/posts/879b8MTWWDf","replies":{"totalItems":2,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13hhhsqwm3xjnjde23xtlybdovvcfbnb/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13hhhsqwm3xjnjde23xtlybdovvcfbnb/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13hhhsqwm3xjnjde23xtlybdovvcfbnb/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
