Other than that it would be just an awesome scrap booking tool to use for my life in general. To be able to use it for my own do it yourself for computer networking and computer repair. Man in other words the sky is the limit with it. If I was able to test it out I don&#39;t think it would come off my head. What a test subject I would make, wow how exciting. Well hope you choose me!!","url":"https://plus.google.com/111017391314059813669/posts/UMW4zP4kNdu","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12wf32i2t3ywll5304ci3mbppbnephiss00k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12wf32i2t3ywll5304ci3mbppbnephiss00k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12wf32i2t3ywll5304ci3mbppbnephiss00k/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
