He gravitates to music and loves certain songs. I don&#39;t always know how to play them for him...currently I have to set down the guitar google guitar tabs on my laptop. As a result my son looses interest and I struggle to keep him focused. But with the glasses I would be able to look up the music while playing smoothly. This would greatly help my son learn and increase our quality of life.","url":"https://plus.google.com/102686954237126383563/posts/Fr3Zhe1XJib","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12kezjzava0i5s2s23cyldbitirxxs25/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12kezjzava0i5s2s23cyldbitirxxs25/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12kezjzava0i5s2s23cyldbitirxxs25/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
