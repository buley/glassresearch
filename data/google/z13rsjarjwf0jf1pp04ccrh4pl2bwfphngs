Every student in the world would love to have one of these glasses to improve their studying abilities and enjoy the life around campus. It would give a great ability to provide canted pictures of other students and even give a more adequate blog on how life is spent on campuses! From the College student&#39;s eyes to the future generation!","url":"https://plus.google.com/107011108142255115888/posts/XHTALw4q5jk","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13rsjarjwf0jf1pp04ccrh4pl2bwfphngs/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13rsjarjwf0jf1pp04ccrh4pl2bwfphngs/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13rsjarjwf0jf1pp04ccrh4pl2bwfphngs/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
