I would do this by building a google TV app that is primarily focused on giving free education to kids who are unable to go to school due to poverty. I will also use it as a mean to show them different countries and culture. They&#39;ve lost their parents because of civil war and do not get the attention they need to learn and I feel this would help them a great deal.","url":"https://plus.google.com/114172320023370601498/posts/9eDmn1xwvWw","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13icxd5lsbmdjpdn22utpkqomqmjls2c/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":2,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13icxd5lsbmdjpdn22utpkqomqmjls2c/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13icxd5lsbmdjpdn22utpkqomqmjls2c/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"Google Glass","content":"Have what it takes to be a Glass Explorer?
