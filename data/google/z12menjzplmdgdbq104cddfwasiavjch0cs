I would also put together physical rehabilitation at-home-videos that patients could use to continue their rehabilitation program in between sessions. I already make videos for my clients and patients, but this would free up my hands so that i would not have to go back and forth between the camera and the client, freeing up my focus on the client.Â <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23ifihadglass\">#ifihadglass</a>","url":"https://plus.google.com/102986673621350395786/posts/ZKf3FLeoAVh","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12menjzplmdgdbq104cddfwasiavjch0cs/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12menjzplmdgdbq104cddfwasiavjch0cs/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12menjzplmdgdbq104cddfwasiavjch0cs/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
