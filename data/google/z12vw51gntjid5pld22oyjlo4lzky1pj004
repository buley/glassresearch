I attend North Dakota State University, and I would be wearing glass during lectures and also at all times throughout my day to really capture the essence of the modern student. I feel as it make me venture more into what I wouldn&#39;t normally do because I could be able to record moments instantly and that would be pretty amazing. It&#39;s a truly incredible piece of equipment and I would be honored to take it on a test run. ","url":"https://plus.google.com/117968299241361639409/posts/7yHGWtThiE2","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12vw51gntjid5pld22oyjlo4lzky1pj004/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12vw51gntjid5pld22oyjlo4lzky1pj004/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12vw51gntjid5pld22oyjlo4lzky1pj004/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
