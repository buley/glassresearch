It would also be lots of fun to talk to my friends or family and see there face while I am walking down the street, it can also make me a better photographer because I would always have them with me. I could even keep blogs of my life I guess? or just take videos of something cool or entertaining and share it right to Facebook or Google+ to share with my friends right there without a flick of my finger. I also give much needed feedback because if I really love the Device or Program I want to make it the best it can be so everyone will love it just as much as do! That is what I would do if i had Google glass.","url":"https://plus.google.com/106579438689170730130/posts/TWcGvPnGnPb","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12hhd4hopbpfrjwy04cebxp4ly3e1c5ju40k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12hhd4hopbpfrjwy04cebxp4ly3e1c5ju40k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12hhd4hopbpfrjwy04cebxp4ly3e1c5ju40k/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"Google Glass","content":"Have what it takes to be a Glass Explorer?
