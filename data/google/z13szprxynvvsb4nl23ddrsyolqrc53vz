I could film labs that we in AP Biology. I could also film long night time drives with my friends. Me and my friends also do many experiments, like making home made rockets, it would be much easier to film with a pair of google glasses(I wouldn&#39;t have to pull out my phone). ","url":"https://plus.google.com/114518952276006999892/posts/KvcGhkuhKzY","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13szprxynvvsb4nl23ddrsyolqrc53vz/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13szprxynvvsb4nl23ddrsyolqrc53vz/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13szprxynvvsb4nl23ddrsyolqrc53vz/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
