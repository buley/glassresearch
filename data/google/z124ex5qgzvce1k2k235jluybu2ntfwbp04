I could use Glass while biking riding, theme parks, concerts, walking, skating, school performances, etc. As being a father that comes with the title of always taking the pictures. With glass I would be able to enjoy the experiences without lugging around a camera. No longer would I have to always look down at my cell phone to receive my information, but continue on with my life. This would allow me to be more interactive.   ","url":"https://plus.google.com/110599999227331762374/posts/ETyGd1sEw8s","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z124ex5qgzvce1k2k235jluybu2ntfwbp04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z124ex5qgzvce1k2k235jluybu2ntfwbp04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z124ex5qgzvce1k2k235jluybu2ntfwbp04/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"album","displayName":"","id":"110599999227331762374.5849805263696800385","url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/110599999227331762374/albums/5849805263696800385?authkey=CMDJ6sbls_PMSw","thumbnails":[{"url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/110599999227331762374/albums/5849805263696800385/5849805263925446770?authkey=CMDJ6sbls_PMSw","description":"","image":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-aLOLeAYwGQI/US6u5Nl8iHI/AAAAAAAAzwo/CK67qWrTp3c/w497-h373/CIMG3666.JPG","type":"image/jpeg","height":373,"width":497}},{"url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/110599999227331762374/albums/5849805263696800385/5849805493892989714?authkey=CMDJ6sbls_PMSw","description":"","image":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-abfcp3HFRlQ/US6vGmSewxI/AAAAAAAAzww/AQheH0WH624/w78-h78-p/IMG_0402.JPG","type":"image/jpeg","height":78,"width":78}},{"url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/110599999227331762374/albums/5849805263696800385/5849806040720846914?authkey=CMDJ6sbls_PMSw","description":"","image":{"url":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-dwG7-u09cZA/US6vmbYZsEI/AAAAAAAAzw4/-kM2zS1UEl8/w78-h78-p/IMG_0611.JPG","type":"image/jpeg","height":78,"width":78}},{"url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/110599999227331762374/albums/5849805263696800385/5849807080449324146?authkey=CMDJ6sbls_PMSw","description":"","image":{"url":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-jwGsfYx5PPA/US6wi8q_NHI/AAAAAAAAzxA/hwfHynuRMGY/w78-h78-p/P1200097.JPG","type":"image/jpeg","height":78,"width":78}},{"url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/110599999227331762374/albums/5849805263696800385/5849807311372698642?authkey=CMDJ6sbls_PMSw","description":"","image":{"url":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-1-PTfkJHko8/US6wwY7aRBI/AAAAAAAAzxI/p-omaBu9Jlg/w78-h78-p/l_31138effcbd3c57f9118aa0196da4d12.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","height":78,"width":78}},{"url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/110599999227331762374/albums/5849805263696800385/5849807566649036466?authkey=CMDJ6sbls_PMSw","description":"","image":{"url":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-TwqtmfMmskU/US6w_P6CDrI/AAAAAAAAzxQ/L_aXVrgJgtM/w78-h78-p/IMG_0654.JPG","type":"image/jpeg","height":78,"width":78}}]}]},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
