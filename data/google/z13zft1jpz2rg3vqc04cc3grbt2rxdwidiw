The app picks an object from my sight, figure out its name by Google image search and shows the name in the language I&#39;m learning. Optionally speaks the word. Then I can continue learning words toujours. I hope Google Glass2 could project image on the whole sight of both eyes and overlay 3D objects on my sight. I want an app which shows words as a vast 3D graph by collocation, derivation, conjugation, association, etc. I want to traverse the graph from word to word.","url":"https://plus.google.com/109225959334531945935/posts/abdKhh1KpmT","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13zft1jpz2rg3vqc04cc3grbt2rxdwidiw/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13zft1jpz2rg3vqc04cc3grbt2rxdwidiw/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13zft1jpz2rg3vqc04cc3grbt2rxdwidiw/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
