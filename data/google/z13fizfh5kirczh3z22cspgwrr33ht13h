I&#39;d be willing to do anything. Personally i would really want to show the world wild animals! I would love to film the beauty of observing wild animals in there natural habitat. I would want to show them, if possible, a view from space.I wouldn&#39;t care about appearances i&#39;d wear it proudly; in fact I find them quite fashionable. Life is to beautiful to let one second pass by and who knows what you&#39;re going to see next! i&#39;d love to experience a lot of things and if i had google glass i&#39;d love to play them back and relive the moment","url":"https://plus.google.com/108545411592053258593/posts/NK1YLWiuTEm","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13fizfh5kirczh3z22cspgwrr33ht13h/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13fizfh5kirczh3z22cspgwrr33ht13h/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13fizfh5kirczh3z22cspgwrr33ht13h/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
