I can also use the Glass for homework, by &quot;sharing&quot; the picture or video of the assignment or information collected from the smart board. If I had this Glass and my school did, the students and my grades will improved dramatically because we would be active in our school world and in our technology world.<br />The Glass looks amazing and I would be honored to use the Glass for school because it can dramatically improve my grades and keep me up to date for school assignments.","url":"https://plus.google.com/118376295435643577856/posts/G8c5SbCQiVU","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13zsnlrbkesu5iuu22xifla4z2tf3au0/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13zsnlrbkesu5iuu22xifla4z2tf3au0/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13zsnlrbkesu5iuu22xifla4z2tf3au0/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"Google Glass","content":"Have what it takes to be a Glass Explorer?
