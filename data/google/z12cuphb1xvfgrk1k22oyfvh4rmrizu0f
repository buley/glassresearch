I go to a small liberal arts college outside Green Bay that has heavy emphasis on its students studying abroad, and seeing that only 2% of American college students study abroad per year, I feel that it is important to utilise this technology to encourage my fellow Americans to interact with the rest of the world through the experiences I will live through. I am going to study in both Europe and Australia, so while I am limited to only two continents, I still hope to show my countrymen the beauty of the world through my adventures to aid in what I can only hope will be an increased interest in international integration. Glass has the potential to change the way the world&#39;s nations see each other for the better!","url":"https://plus.google.com/103926689883594795576/posts/97ZDvFAhKfW","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12cuphb1xvfgrk1k22oyfvh4rmrizu0f/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12cuphb1xvfgrk1k22oyfvh4rmrizu0f/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12cuphb1xvfgrk1k22oyfvh4rmrizu0f/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
