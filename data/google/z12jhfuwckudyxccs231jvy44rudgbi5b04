I&#39;m known as being technology proficient and the courts I practice in are cognizant of technological abilities. This could be the next step from using the Ipad in the courtroom.  Now we can record what we see, discreetly.  I would love to try Glass in the legal environment.","url":"https://plus.google.com/111186241889153745219/posts/54PzTDtCWEq","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12jhfuwckudyxccs231jvy44rudgbi5b04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12jhfuwckudyxccs231jvy44rudgbi5b04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12jhfuwckudyxccs231jvy44rudgbi5b04/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
