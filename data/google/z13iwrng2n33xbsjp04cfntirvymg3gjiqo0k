With Google Glass and an e-911 service that could be reduced to less than a second with a simple panic button, and sending a photo or video to the dispatcher. A photo of the attacker from 3 feet away will always be better than a verbal description. Google Glass WILL have an impact on reducing violent crime.","url":"https://plus.google.com/114237874604374930059/posts/i7D54nzXnZi","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13iwrng2n33xbsjp04cfntirvymg3gjiqo0k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":2,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13iwrng2n33xbsjp04cfntirvymg3gjiqo0k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13iwrng2n33xbsjp04cfntirvymg3gjiqo0k/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
