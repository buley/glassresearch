And finally I would take a video of her on our wedding day so I can see her at her most beautiful and never forget what she looked like through my eyes. Also I&#39;m really bad with directions and a GPS that I can&#39;t lose would help alot :). I just think that, With Glass, the world through my eyes and not just my eyes but everyone&#39;s, will turn into memories that will live forever :) and I really like that idea and I&#39;d love to be a part of what I want to call the eyes of the world :) ","url":"https://plus.google.com/113645698992712340432/posts/CVo9odKgxB1","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12whl55clreylre423jhh0ppzf2cjzr504/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12whl55clreylre423jhh0ppzf2cjzr504/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12whl55clreylre423jhh0ppzf2cjzr504/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
