You&#39;d look at me and think everything is normal and you&#39;re still a person, but I&#39;m looking through the corner of my eye and seeing you as a person with a giant cat head. You look ridiculous.<br /><br />I&#39;d do this using an open-source imaging library such as OpenCV for video face detection and probably try to detect hair color or even current mood in determining what type of cat to show you as, but you don&#39;t care about these details because you&#39;re a cat.<br /><br />Some might call the act of turning everyone into a cat dehumanizing, but to quote the great poet Rob Zombie: &quot;I am Electric Head... More Human Than Human.&quot; (He&#39;s talking about me, not you; you&#39;re a pudgy-faced Russian Blue).<br /><br />This was longer than the 50-word submission limit but cats can&#39;t count.","url":"https://plus.google.com/105319962076958410545/posts/YJuuKkxAMNt","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13ysjq5fyb2vp5xv04cg1y5mxmqtpppa50/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13ysjq5fyb2vp5xv04cg1y5mxmqtpppa50/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13ysjq5fyb2vp5xv04cg1y5mxmqtpppa50/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"photo","id":"105319962076958410545.5849499362101598642","content":"catface.jpg","url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/105319962076958410545/albums/5849499363340657473/5849499362101598642?authkey=CKO6x6qoqp3pFQ","image":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-F1TUlbs-ZP4/US2YrYfwmbI/AAAAAAAADKE/BLIzts_04JI/w497-h373/catface.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","height":373,"width":497},"fullImage":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-F1TUlbs-ZP4/US2YrYfwmbI/AAAAAAAADKE/BLIzts_04JI/catface.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","height":720,"width":1080}}]},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
