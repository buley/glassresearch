I wish I had it earlier when I jumped out of a plane in a pink shirt with it in 2009 but maybe I will earn a chance now to share this journey of fundraising with everyone.  The event is in Glendale, Colorado sometime in August. ","url":"https://plus.google.com/109931720898576608083/posts/1m3FUpzuBwg","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12huvqjwxi5cjlc423ozdharwrczzos4/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12huvqjwxi5cjlc423ozdharwrczzos4/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12huvqjwxi5cjlc423ozdharwrczzos4/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
