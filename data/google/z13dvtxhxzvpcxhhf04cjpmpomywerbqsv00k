I would have embedded a camera on to of a drone possibly a quad-roter and I could see directly what it sees in my glass. Not stopping there, i would add various of commands through the glass in order to guide the drone around. Maybe if there was a swarm of drones they could inform me in my class in they find a survivor and update visually be with his/hers vital status. I could do that because my thesis is (under development): vision based navigation on an embedded flying robotic platform.","url":"https://plus.google.com/107954003442544447984/posts/VfwWsGMJ6s4","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13dvtxhxzvpcxhhf04cjpmpomywerbqsv00k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13dvtxhxzvpcxhhf04cjpmpomywerbqsv00k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13dvtxhxzvpcxhhf04cjpmpomywerbqsv00k/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"Google Glass","content":"Have what it takes to be a Glass Explorer?
