Allow glass to walk me around my favorite stores and street. Show my family what awesome things I am experiencing like have them virtually be at the concert. Have them experience what its like riding my bike at 30 miles per hour or watch how I break ankles live with my killer cross-over.  Tell my girlfriend I miss her and wish she was seeing this. Record my hole in one (if that will ever happen)  Get me to my gate on time and translate for me so I can buy and eat this grilled spider on the streets of Cambodia. Maybe even take photos of my patients in the ER for educational purposes, recording life threatening illness in real time may be a invaluable tool to my residents who are just learning how to be an ER doctor.","url":"https://plus.google.com/114272282172600205686/posts/PhPgt2yZjh3","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13hfpra2rj4xlq4b04cjjtpno2df3ag4sk0k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13hfpra2rj4xlq4b04cjjtpno2df3ag4sk0k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13hfpra2rj4xlq4b04cjjtpno2df3ag4sk0k/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"Google Glass","content":"Have what it takes to be a Glass Explorer?
