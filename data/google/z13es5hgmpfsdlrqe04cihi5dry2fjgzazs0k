Living a life that consists of constantly taking pictures or videos I think the glass wouldcome in very handy. I have always wanted to test a product but could never get ahold of anyone that gave an opportunity to do something as amazing as what google is offering. I have always been a big supporter of google and will continue to be, I would be thrilled to get the opportunity to help in testing something that will change the world. Google has once again outdone themselves as always. I have always wanted something exactly like what the glass is. Pick me google and you won&#39;t be sorry.","url":"https://plus.google.com/101067890014678946599/posts/aunwhmdLfQG","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13es5hgmpfsdlrqe04cihi5dry2fjgzazs0k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13es5hgmpfsdlrqe04cihi5dry2fjgzazs0k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13es5hgmpfsdlrqe04cihi5dry2fjgzazs0k/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"Google Glass","content":"Have what it takes to be a Glass Explorer?
