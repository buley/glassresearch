I can plan my route ahead of time and no getting out the map or even my phone - just keep peddling! As far as ideas I haven&#39;t seen: I would appreciate an app that could show the path ahead with a different color when I am behind the lead time for running the same course as previous runs or even to compete with friends. I wonder how durable these things are, I mean can they handle rainy weather?","url":"https://plus.google.com/102326788330643903152/posts/LAHvXt3UNgK","replies":{"totalItems":2,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12eetxzporcwnlnm22eyl5bhwqye1lf3/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12eetxzporcwnlnm22eyl5bhwqye1lf3/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12eetxzporcwnlnm22eyl5bhwqye1lf3/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"Google Glass","content":"Have what it takes to be a Glass Explorer?
