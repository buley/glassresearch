I look forward to the day that we can begin testing and playing with the complete capabilities of Glass.","url":"https://plus.google.com/113004963765689403024/posts/B1puRB4rVgz","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12fx5fpno2iw5vtv230ifiyuybyx1mb104/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12fx5fpno2iw5vtv230ifiyuybyx1mb104/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12fx5fpno2iw5vtv230ifiyuybyx1mb104/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Community"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
