Part of the point of this toy box is to help bridge the digital divide throughout Kansas communities, another purpose is to inspire by letting library patrons and staff get hands on time with new technology. Finally it would be used to explore! Find out how this type of communication can be used with the ever changing world of libraries. I&#39;m sure the &quot;maker&quot; people would love to get their hands on it and I would be sure to include it in my upcoming presentations on bringing digital creation into the &quot;real&quot; world.","url":"https://plus.google.com/113482915061400467902/posts/HGodGdPsnPe","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13mwrwb5y21xrd3122gcjtwqnzrdbnhn04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13mwrwb5y21xrd3122gcjtwqnzrdbnhn04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13mwrwb5y21xrd3122gcjtwqnzrdbnhn04/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
