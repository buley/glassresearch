I would make them see the joy on the faces of the poor and the homeless when they are offered food and share their stories with the world as they have shared it with me. I would show the world the amount of satisfaction one gets when you get a hug and the show these people that you care. I would tell the world that age and profession does not matter and society has to be fought with in order to make a difference. I would like to show the world that a 16 year old school going Indian living in New Delhi can make change, so why can’t they? <br />(I know that I do not fulfill the eligibility criteria but exceptions are always needed) ","url":"https://plus.google.com/103423325144162336009/posts/UxcY6EzfeYq","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z135jfn5slegir4xb04cdlbipkf0effjk30/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z135jfn5slegir4xb04cdlbipkf0effjk30/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z135jfn5slegir4xb04cdlbipkf0effjk30/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
