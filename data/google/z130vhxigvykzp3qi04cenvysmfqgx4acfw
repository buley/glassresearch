A bassoonist to be exact.  If I had the opportunity to try this I would use it in my rehearsals to record the conductors movements and correctly interpret what the conductors want and how he or she is keeping the beat. <br /><br />Not only that but when I am practicing.  If It is possible, have a tuner and a metronome on the glass to keep track of practice and when I listen to music, I can see where my part is in the music according to glass.  <br /><br />There are other possibilities   Like if I was a conductor and to look at a score and see what the analysis of the music through glass and the glass record my cues for the musician in a symphonic band or orchestra.<br /><br />I can see musicians taking great advantages with this device.  I hope that I can be able to be a part of something that I know will change the world in what we do. ","url":"https://plus.google.com/102456734268919202537/posts/bUbJrgXb19a","replies":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z130vhxigvykzp3qi04cenvysmfqgx4acfw/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z130vhxigvykzp3qi04cenvysmfqgx4acfw/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z130vhxigvykzp3qi04cenvysmfqgx4acfw/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
