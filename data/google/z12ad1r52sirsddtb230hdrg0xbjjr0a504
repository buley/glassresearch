I&#39;d like to create a social network called  <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23seethruglass\">#seethruglass</a>  where glass users can broadcast their lives as they see it and save the files for future viewing and as a daily diary/archive of their ongoings. This is huge for educators, business training development, quality and safety compliance, and the jobs of police and otherwise civil safety servants. I hope you all see the vision. If I get a pair of glass glasses, I will build the site in a day! Let&#39;s make education, business and government more functional and responsible!","url":"https://plus.google.com/116632213208541213765/posts/7aJpjP4W5EK","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12ad1r52sirsddtb230hdrg0xbjjr0a504/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12ad1r52sirsddtb230hdrg0xbjjr0a504/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12ad1r52sirsddtb230hdrg0xbjjr0a504/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
