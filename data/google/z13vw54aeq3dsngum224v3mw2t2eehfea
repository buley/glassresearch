I could check my messages, email, or just the time in private without having to stop whatever I was doing to dig my phone out of my pocket. I would be able to record my professors comments and lectures while taking my own notes my hand. I could document the various buildings and landmarks I see as I travel on field trips. Glass would streamline many of my everyday tasks as well as allow me to step into the future of technology.","url":"https://plus.google.com/101616626125304882305/posts/EnNgNzBnTbL","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13vw54aeq3dsngum224v3mw2t2eehfea/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13vw54aeq3dsngum224v3mw2t2eehfea/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13vw54aeq3dsngum224v3mw2t2eehfea/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"Google Glass","content":"Have what it takes to be a Glass Explorer?
