I&#39;d use it in class and test the different style choices. Educate when people ask me what they are and capture every amazing moment in life. I would go explore and find the limits of the device. Use it in education and getting around school/campus. Technology inspires me, and I wish to start making YouTube videos, but the camera on my android isn&#39;t up to par and it&#39;s uncomfortable to hold. I&#39;d love to be chosen and i&#39;d be honored.","url":"https://plus.google.com/111311622676042454881/posts/64F9zfnz22x","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13axdyh3vaucxbcy231xrjyytrtzz0rt04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13axdyh3vaucxbcy231xrjyytrtzz0rt04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13axdyh3vaucxbcy231xrjyytrtzz0rt04/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
