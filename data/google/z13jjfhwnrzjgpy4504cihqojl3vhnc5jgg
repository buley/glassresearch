One the parts of Derm visits is to map out any, and something many, skin &quot;suspects&quot; and watch them for a few weeks or months. <br /><br />During the visit the Dermatologist would use glass to photograph suspect spots while creating a relational map with internal sensors. This information is stored in their EMR and when they return the Dermatologist starts the visit looking at the earlier spot and Glass tells him where to go. With this a different Dermatologist could follow the same route and see the changes side-by-side, something previously not close to being practical.<br /><br />It&#39;s also possible to quickly guess if the lesion is a suspect or not some help from the cloud.<br /><br />This gives Dermatologists what they love: lots of now &amp; later pictures. There&#39;s no reason a Derm RN couldn&#39;t do the screening with Glass and review with the MD.,<br /><br />One of the ways Glass will save lives. Just find a Dermatologist will to try.","url":"https://plus.google.com/100875886292765825454/posts/PQQY3h8Y3BB","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13jjfhwnrzjgpy4504cihqojl3vhnc5jgg/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13jjfhwnrzjgpy4504cihqojl3vhnc5jgg/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13jjfhwnrzjgpy4504cihqojl3vhnc5jgg/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
