With the use of glass, i]I can document all the trials and turmoil that goes on everyday with the farm life. It is much more complex than just sitting in a tractor all day.<br /><br />I would also be able to highlight the life of a teen that would hopefully help dispel some of the stereotypes and cliches that are portrayed about my age group. I will be able to show how involved I am in the community along with how I help people on a daily basis. The world is full of misconceptions about how people live, and if I had glass, I would be able to help shine light of how there is good in the world and the life of people in a small town. Life is much more than a desk job but rather the interactions with friends, family, and coworkers.","url":"https://plus.google.com/107161237818883271001/posts/dcbjHXM8WFX","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13vgdbofoqvt1wyu04chnjqlkyoyheihzc0k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13vgdbofoqvt1wyu04chnjqlkyoyheihzc0k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13vgdbofoqvt1wyu04chnjqlkyoyheihzc0k/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
