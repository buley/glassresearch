People wouldn&#39;t have to give up jogging because it isn&#39;t interesting enough for them. The app would monitor the heart rate, and present users with various interesting tasks to have a balanced training session. Also it would be fun developing an app to promote a healthier lifestyle. And also it would be very useful to give hints in medicine.","url":"https://plus.google.com/113657904970783385644/posts/R2uCQqMW26k","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13wt5fhgs35uvpwj04cjnd52teqiviwko00k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13wt5fhgs35uvpwj04cjnd52teqiviwko00k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13wt5fhgs35uvpwj04cjnd52teqiviwko00k/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
