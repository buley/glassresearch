I would create an augmented reality application that allows users to hide a “treasure cache” (virtual or real), post the geo-coordinates on a website (either <a href=\"http://geocaching.com\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">geocaching.com</a> or <a href=\"http://opencaching.com\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">opencaching.com</a>). It would then allow other treasure hunters to select and navigate to a cache by following a virtual compass projected onto the screen. Glass would also tell users if there are any nearby caches as the user goes about exploring a place and would show navigation aids like waypoints or signboards to reach this virtual treasure. One would also be able to vlog this entire adventure!","url":"https://plus.google.com/112974189832506757663/posts/EkHQuf82eh9","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12mehspbyr5fx5um22ccrlrdp3ctjlrn04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12mehspbyr5fx5um22ccrlrdp3ctjlrn04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12mehspbyr5fx5um22ccrlrdp3ctjlrn04/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"Google Glass","content":"Have what it takes to be a Glass Explorer?
