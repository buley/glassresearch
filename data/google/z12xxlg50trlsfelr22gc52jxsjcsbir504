You could even integrate gps navigation info for display, too. Ideally it would be cheap enough that private pilots could afford it. Airline pilots already have much of this data available. <br /><br />Of course i&#39;m quite sure i can&#39;t participate in this <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23ifihadglass\">#ifihadglass</a> thing anyway. :p <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23ifihadaraspberrypi\">#ifihadaraspberrypi</a> would also apply. haha","url":"https://plus.google.com/109579029194781557900/posts/AFkpe3yZSdG","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12xxlg50trlsfelr22gc52jxsjcsbir504/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12xxlg50trlsfelr22gc52jxsjcsbir504/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12xxlg50trlsfelr22gc52jxsjcsbir504/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Mobile"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
