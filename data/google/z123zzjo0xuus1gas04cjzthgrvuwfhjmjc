If I would experience testing or owning one, I would be generous enough to share my knowledge to other people, not only will I let others know about it but it will make them realize that technology has come a long way from abacus to the Google Glass. It is a big step in technology and considering it&#39;s features I&#39;m looking forward to how it will play out. I know Google will never overhype their avid consumers. I hope Google will soon give me the chance to own a Google Glass.","url":"https://plus.google.com/117716218704469708213/posts/dC7JyXRbknz","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z123zzjo0xuus1gas04cjzthgrvuwfhjmjc/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z123zzjo0xuus1gas04cjzthgrvuwfhjmjc/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z123zzjo0xuus1gas04cjzthgrvuwfhjmjc/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
