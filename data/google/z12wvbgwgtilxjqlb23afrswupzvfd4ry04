Life would be more like a dream. Its like being Iron man having Jarvis always with you to help to serve to make the chores in life well simpler and I must say much cooler. Glass would be like the hand held camera or smart phones where we all carry to snap and record epic moments of our lives. It makes the past less of  a distant dream but more of a re-liveable reality in the future. Glass would make mine or in fact any person&#39;s life complete. ","url":"https://plus.google.com/100490501842040410794/posts/7eDrtJh5hAG","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12wvbgwgtilxjqlb23afrswupzvfd4ry04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12wvbgwgtilxjqlb23afrswupzvfd4ry04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12wvbgwgtilxjqlb23afrswupzvfd4ry04/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
