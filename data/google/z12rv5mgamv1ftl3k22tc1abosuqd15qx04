I have muscular dystrophy and its hard to walk this would allow me to take video and pictures from an easier perspective without having to hold a bulky camera. I would be able to facebook and twitter short clips each day much easier and stay in touch with a wide audience to broaden my youtube channel and just enjoy life more. I wish I could afford something like this today! This technology is sooo exciting!","url":"https://plus.google.com/115350471288355501523/posts/KpjLTFivLz2","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12rv5mgamv1ftl3k22tc1abosuqd15qx04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12rv5mgamv1ftl3k22tc1abosuqd15qx04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12rv5mgamv1ftl3k22tc1abosuqd15qx04/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
