I am a Special Education teacher and I constantly use videos for instruction. Most Special Education students are visual learners and I go through hours of prep to make them. I write on my white board and have to set up cameras and microphones to create video lessons. I also run a summer Science Camp and also video my lessons and post them to my website for parents to see lessons for the day. The freedom of wireless, voice activated video recording would be a huge asset with instruction! This technology is a dream come true but unfortunately out of the price range for an educator.","url":"https://plus.google.com/108676949717543069756/posts/fPCA3uZ7AtM","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13fhxuwsvnzy3jb504chzrb1um3gtwil20/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13fhxuwsvnzy3jb504chzrb1um3gtwil20/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13fhxuwsvnzy3jb504chzrb1um3gtwil20/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
