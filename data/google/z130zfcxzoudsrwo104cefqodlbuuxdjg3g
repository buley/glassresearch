That would be great for people looking for a flat in certain region, it will also make a user be more geo-aware, and walk more. Also interesting for tourists, Airbnb-style.","url":"https://plus.google.com/115220882337224830471/posts/Nj7HZp3JqXE","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z130zfcxzoudsrwo104cefqodlbuuxdjg3g/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z130zfcxzoudsrwo104cefqodlbuuxdjg3g/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z130zfcxzoudsrwo104cefqodlbuuxdjg3g/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Mobile"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
