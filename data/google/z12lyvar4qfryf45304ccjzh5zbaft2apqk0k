I have so manytimes, where i was out and i wished i had my camera on me so i could get that amazing moment and share it with people, so they can see my amzing moment too. If i had the glass i wouldnt need to remember my camera because i would have one already on me for my eye point off veiw Off what I captured of recored. It would come in good handy too because As a musician I would have the glass with me when I&#39;m taking part in Carnival all over the world. So while i&#39;m performing i can keep record everthing i see in different countries and never forget that memory. But the glass would come in handy when i&#39;m in the hospital fighting for life. I could get a picture off the people whos helping me to get better and live to see another day.","url":"https://plus.google.com/104971109557546741123/posts/UHaUZRYkRmc","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12lyvar4qfryf45304ccjzh5zbaft2apqk0k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12lyvar4qfryf45304ccjzh5zbaft2apqk0k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12lyvar4qfryf45304ccjzh5zbaft2apqk0k/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"Google Glass","content":"Have what it takes to be a Glass Explorer?
