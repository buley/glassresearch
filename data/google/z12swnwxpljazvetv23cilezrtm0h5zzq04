I have a knack of taking some of those pictures over the years. Over 2 years, I have taken time off from a crazy work schedule to explore different cultures. I plan to visit the following places over the next few months for business and pleasure :<br />Seoul : Cherry blossom festival, DMZ, Nami Islands<br />Countryside in Dresden, Germany and Czech Republic : Explore local porcelain and crystal manufacturing<br />Valencia Spain : La Tomatina  (tomato fight) &amp; La Raima (grape fight) festivals<br />Street festivals in SF, Europe and Asia (Summer 2013)<br /><br />Life has lots to offer and I have the intent to explore  :)","url":"https://plus.google.com/109155720213572747466/posts/Avi2LD1E856","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12swnwxpljazvetv23cilezrtm0h5zzq04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12swnwxpljazvetv23cilezrtm0h5zzq04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12swnwxpljazvetv23cilezrtm0h5zzq04/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
