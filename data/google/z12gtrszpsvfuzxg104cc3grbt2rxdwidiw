When I load them into fridge or cabinet, I glance at the bar-codes. When I trash an empty package, glance again. On driving home I can vocally ask Glass the remaining amount of milk. Or it automatically reminds me of something running out. I should rather do the incoming scan when the things moving on the conveyor belt at the ckeckout to save time and record the place. Glass reminds me next time I&#39;m at the same store. Oh, a better idea has come up to mind, receipt at a glance. OCR captures more precise data.","url":"https://plus.google.com/109225959334531945935/posts/NjMjDgwk6o2","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12gtrszpsvfuzxg104cc3grbt2rxdwidiw/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12gtrszpsvfuzxg104cc3grbt2rxdwidiw/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12gtrszpsvfuzxg104cc3grbt2rxdwidiw/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
