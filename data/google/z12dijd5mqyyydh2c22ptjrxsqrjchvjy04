Then there are all the possibilities of using Glass with Hexxa and the gamification aspects - very real, very doable and very game changing!  <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23ifihadglass\">#ifihadglass</a>","url":"https://plus.google.com/100023454826187342845/posts/D7VU81JmWnV","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12dijd5mqyyydh2c22ptjrxsqrjchvjy04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":2,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12dijd5mqyyydh2c22ptjrxsqrjchvjy04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12dijd5mqyyydh2c22ptjrxsqrjchvjy04/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
