Project would include live route map and HUD data, photo stream, video journal of riders, world-class racers and average commuters. Afterwards, I should be able to use GPS and maps data to post visual trail markers and media for other Glass or Android users so they may follow the route in the future and, perhaps, learn a few tips from professional racers. These photos are a sample from last year&#39;s ride.","url":"https://plus.google.com/112124537314272512405/posts/UjNzq49xYR5","replies":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z134dln50pvqtvth504cib2bjvfrsliau4k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z134dln50pvqtvth504cib2bjvfrsliau4k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z134dln50pvqtvth504cib2bjvfrsliau4k/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"album","displayName":"rideonwashington","id":"112124537314272512405.5849724075370030673","url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/112124537314272512405/albums/5849724075370030673?authkey=CIGVnaibnd_VRg","thumbnails":[{"url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/112124537314272512405/albums/5849724075370030673/5849724079114718130?authkey=CIGVnaibnd_VRg","description":"","image":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-5o-nM2b6KTk/US5lDomui7I/AAAAAAAAADY/UXtYGN_ElxM/w165-h165-p/IMG_7357.JPG","type":"image/jpeg","height":165,"width":165}},{"url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/112124537314272512405/albums/5849724075370030673/5849724079651816706?authkey=CIGVnaibnd_VRg","description":"","image":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-MbGT7R1G7yc/US5lDqmyBQI/AAAAAAAAADM/x4FDApqewwo/w165-h165-p/IMG_7366.JPG","type":"image/jpeg","height":165,"width":165}},{"url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/112124537314272512405/albums/5849724075370030673/5849724083054729122?authkey=CIGVnaibnd_VRg","description":"","image":{"url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-WGLMfk6dJZ0/US5lD3SGV6I/AAAAAAAAADQ/ok3GuLutSV0/w165-h165-p/IMG_7372.JPG","type":"image/jpeg","height":165,"width":165}}]}]},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
