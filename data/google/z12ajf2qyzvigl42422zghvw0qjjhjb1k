Real techs spend way to much time finding specs and documenting repairs. All this could be  streamlined with Glass. Most repair information is searchable (Motors even uses Google search) it is just a pain to look up and a lot of times print out. <br />  Think about walking up  to a vehicle and looking at the door frame sticker and having Glass snap a picture of the VIN info and instantly having repair or maintenance info available.<br />  Imagine the customers delight at being able to see still photos and movies of point of failure and repair.<br /><br />  This is the kind of disruptive technology that may put me out of a job, but I would like to be along for the ride.","url":"https://plus.google.com/105703026518990963194/posts/CPwaBn2kZ1d","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12ajf2qyzvigl42422zghvw0qjjhjb1k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12ajf2qyzvigl42422zghvw0qjjhjb1k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12ajf2qyzvigl42422zghvw0qjjhjb1k/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"video","displayName":"BMW Mechanic - Augmented Reality Glasses","content":"This is not the future.
