With the motion tracking capabilities of Glass, you could determine the location of significant potholes by sensing a bumpy portion of the road when a driver goes over it. You could crowdsource this with all Glass users or even simply smartphone users with an app to track this to contribute to the data. You could also track license plates to answe that 'Didn't I see that car this morning?' question. Nothing very useful in that, just pretty interesting.","image":{"url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-us3W2Z1DUuA/USwY9ZVFQGI/AAAAAAAAAKk/h-6qh705goI/w497-h373/gg-driving.png","type":"image/jpeg","height":373,"width":497}},{"url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/115953085879145740179/albums/5849077458310739041/5849078560851436834?authkey=CNKIxZSm0sDwyAE","description":"I would imagine you could speed up Voice Recognition for definitions of words by analyzing the page for possible searches with some kind of OCR.

This is more of a simple concept than an idea I've thought through like the last two.","image":{"url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-SWIvA2iThEM/USwaGwkMCAI/AAAAAAAAALA/44yxjaM7MAo/w78-h78-p/gg-location.png","type":"image/jpeg","height":78,"width":78}},{"url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/115953085879145740179/albums/5849077458310739041/5849078851711979058?authkey=CNKIxZSm0sDwyAE","description":"This is one of the more exciting concepts I've come up with. It would be awesome to program in piano music and have Glass highlight the keys you need to play, but it would likely be quite inaccurate. More feasibly, you could do some kind of note recognition to display stats such as accuracy or completion, as exemplified in the concept image.","image":{"url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-pq71IWOMsEY/USwaOdOKzjI/AAAAAAAAALM/-TcfVxMcfiI/w78-h78-p/gg-piano1.png","type":"image/jpeg","height":78,"width":78}},{"url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/115953085879145740179/albums/5849077458310739041/5849078984151518466?authkey=CNKIxZSm0sDwyAE","description":"My homemade POV device...
