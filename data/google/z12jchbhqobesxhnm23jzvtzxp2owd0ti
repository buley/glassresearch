I would use google glasses to view ebooks in study sessions while drawing illustrations and ideas across the whiteboard. I would wear it during foreign movies to see if I can get real time sub titles. I would look up recipes while my hands are tied up cooking. I would reference speech notes in real time when I&#39;m giving my Toastmasters speech to an audience. I would also record audience facial reactions during the speech to help improve overall speaking techniques. I would hear a song on the radio, launch an app like SoundHound through google glasses, and sing along with lyrics. I would look at music notes and tabs as I learn to play on the guitar. I would pull up youtube videos on how to tie a tie while I&#39;m in front of the mirror learning to tie it. And in the case of a medical emergency in public, I could literally save a life by looking at first aid instructions while administering care.","url":"https://plus.google.com/107658943990205220178/posts/L93ZhPF5b5o","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12jchbhqobesxhnm23jzvtzxp2owd0ti/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12jchbhqobesxhnm23jzvtzxp2owd0ti/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12jchbhqobesxhnm23jzvtzxp2owd0ti/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
