Coaches communicate with players on the football field through wireless communication, by telling the players different strategies to maneuver on the field. Coaches initially have a white board in which they have to speak to players about strategies. during the breaks. <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23ifihadglass\">#ifihadglass</a>, I would propose this to football coaches. The virtual display on the glass play by play can be transmitted to the other players on the field, so they know exactly where to move since it is VISUAL COMMUNICATION, because recently it was through wireless communication. The coach as well as the player can see whats happening now. Can google glasses change sports ? PROJECT GLASS can make this happen and will! :)","url":"https://plus.google.com/112488803037173685841/posts/1U9mT93tf7P","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12ctjtifkuhcnugx04ce5nrcqyxu5ax4h4/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12ctjtifkuhcnugx04ce5nrcqyxu5ax4h4/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12ctjtifkuhcnugx04ce5nrcqyxu5ax4h4/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"album","displayName":"","id":"112488803037173685841.5849746114866649409","url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/112488803037173685841/albums/5849746114866649409?authkey=CPnf1Mvw1NiayQE","thumbnails":[{"url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/112488803037173685841/albums/5849746114866649409/5849746114637034066?authkey=CPnf1Mvw1NiayQE","description":"","image":{"url":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-szkkVUikpVk/US55GRUpclI/AAAAAAAAACs/kQSp2NncBok/w165-h165-p/football-and-free-motion-quilting-play-diagrams-as-quilting-guides%2B%25281%2529.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","height":165,"width":165}},{"url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/112488803037173685841/albums/5849746114866649409/5849746512950378514?authkey=CPnf1Mvw1NiayQE","description":"","image":{"url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5yVIFuNqIrU/US55ddJ8wBI/AAAAAAAAAC0/06CGNw1XW3A/w165-h165-p/r-RICH-RODRIGUEZ-FIRED-large570.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","height":165,"width":165}},{"url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/112488803037173685841/albums/5849746114866649409/5849746915189492626?authkey=CPnf1Mvw1NiayQE","description":"","image":{"url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-YDOahI5pHP8/US5503nOi5I/AAAAAAAAAC8/2BglvdsHUfE/w165-h165-p/Google-Glasses.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","height":165,"width":165}}]}]},"annotation":"public","provider":{"title":"Reshared Post"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
