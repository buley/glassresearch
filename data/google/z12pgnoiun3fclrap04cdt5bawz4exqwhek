Glass would provide a notification prompt when I came within a certain distance of a portal sigal. Glass would record this location if I viewed this sigal for the first time for notifying other Glass users. When I viewed the sigal. Glass would ask me if I wanted to load the app associated with the sigal. Sigals would provide a reference to localized applications and their data. Examples could include a community board, bus/subway schedules, historical/informational facts (Such as in a museum.). Google could rent these references or rent relational recommendations that could appear within the application. Realms could be created based on the relational data within G+ connections. This is how I would use Glass. However Glass needs an open Sigal/Symbol registry.","url":"https://plus.google.com/113141855796570742022/posts/ckLzf7PMQhX","replies":{"totalItems":2,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12pgnoiun3fclrap04cdt5bawz4exqwhek/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":2,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12pgnoiun3fclrap04cdt5bawz4exqwhek/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12pgnoiun3fclrap04cdt5bawz4exqwhek/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Community"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
