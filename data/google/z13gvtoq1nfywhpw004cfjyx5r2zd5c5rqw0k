BARCS is the largest animal shelter in the Baltimore area. Glass would provide a quick and simple way to take both photos and video of our animals and upload them quickly to our info pages and show the community as well as those looking to adopt or volunteer what animals we have in the shelter. It will also let us document what our staff and volunteers do on a daily basis for these animals and help promote the shelter and possibly draw in people to give these amazing animals loving homes and care as well as attract new volunteers and donations from the community.   ","url":"https://plus.google.com/109463203053447904376/posts/NXPympS2V2Q","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13gvtoq1nfywhpw004cfjyx5r2zd5c5rqw0k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13gvtoq1nfywhpw004cfjyx5r2zd5c5rqw0k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13gvtoq1nfywhpw004cfjyx5r2zd5c5rqw0k/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
