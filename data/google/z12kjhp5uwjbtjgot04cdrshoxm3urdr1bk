As a software engineer and avid user of tablets and smartphones both Android and Apple, I feel like I have a wide range of experience in using different products. I utilize many Google services and sync everything to google as much as possible including Gmail, ALL of my contacts, Google+, Calendar, Picasa Web Albums, and Google Drive. I am also a diverse user who loves Microsoft and Apple products in addition to Google. I feel that I could provide valuable feedback both in design and usability because I am not stuck in one particular mindset. Thanks! I love what you&#39;re doing!","url":"https://plus.google.com/112414537160779143911/posts/Sf6XEiWNSoy","replies":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12kjhp5uwjbtjgot04cdrshoxm3urdr1bk/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":2,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12kjhp5uwjbtjgot04cdrshoxm3urdr1bk/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12kjhp5uwjbtjgot04cdrshoxm3urdr1bk/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
