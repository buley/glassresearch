My school has been using projectors with math notes on the computer for a few years and it feels very confined to me; I would love to switch over to videos which could either be from my own perspective or one of my students. I would also use the technology at my school to record sports games. I coach cross country and squash and often wish we could record more but find it to much of a hassle to actually do, with google glass I could pull this off easily. I also watch many hockey games and the coaches would be ecstatic if I could use this technology to their advantage. I believe google glass has a place in the classroom and I would want to show it. ","url":"https://plus.google.com/118379537030892374767/posts/NbVLuCNxtPN","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z122ufarjwf5wh3g104cdd5ygo2hdhpxzfs/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":2,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z122ufarjwf5wh3g104cdd5ygo2hdhpxzfs/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z122ufarjwf5wh3g104cdd5ygo2hdhpxzfs/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
