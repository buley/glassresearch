To give actors a further possibility to act, to show emotion. To make a &quot;coy look&quot; become utterly tangible. To make &quot;looking away&quot; feel so so real. To bring camerapeople right into the middle of things and thus the audience as well, in an even greater immersion surpassing the once revolutionary, shaky Blair Witch style. <br /><br />Of course there are challenges: one more thing for the actors to concentrate on - but maybe it would just come naturally to them once they get used to their movements becoming a bigger part of the picture.<br /><br />Taking a sometimes bulky camera out of the equation would be an amazing opportunity in the process of filmmaking: two actors, two glasses, one shot. A dream come true.","url":"https://plus.google.com/115536039623172925450/posts/YnoAJeLeYgV","replies":{"totalItems":2,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12ngpt4tumdux1xy04cjvhbekq5j5m5rd4/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12ngpt4tumdux1xy04cjvhbekq5j5m5rd4/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12ngpt4tumdux1xy04cjvhbekq5j5m5rd4/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Mobile"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
