Most of the people I keep in touch with don&#39;t use Google+. Most aren&#39;t tech-savvy or even keep up with new technologies. So, why would I want to try GoogleGlass? What would I do? <br /><br />I&#39;d share LIFE, just the world through my eyes, everyday. I would share the wonders I&#39;ve found in my home town, the ins and outs of all the little things I&#39;ve discovered over the years. I would share experiences and memories through MY eyes. Not a video camera held at arms length, not a self portrait. I would share with the world the small beautiful springs around my small Florida town that not many have seen. A canoe ride with manatees. A bite to eat at that small hole in the wall cafe down the road. A night out with friends at the local bar listening to live music. A sunset at the beach-front park. Or even just a bike ride down a nature trail. <br /><br />It might not be amazing, it might not be new and life changing, but I think, one of the most amazing things about new technology, or technology re-done, is that it is capable of realizing a dream as old as the internet. Shrinking the world, bringing us all closer together. Gathering experiences and knowledge into one large collective database. Sharing what WE do and who WE are, with each other.","url":"https://plus.google.com/114674510436765616018/posts/WtdLATvixjy","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12sj54qxuryi3qhm04cgrvxrqqjyzpr0ks0k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12sj54qxuryi3qhm04cgrvxrqqjyzpr0ks0k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12sj54qxuryi3qhm04cgrvxrqqjyzpr0ks0k/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
