I also used to work for Redbull energy drink. My life is pretty much observing people and kind of taking account of what they do and why they do it. I have good technology such as the Iphone and apple products but it is not enough if i am walking by and see something beautiful or awesome in front of me and cannot take the time to hang up the phone or look for a camera in my pocket. I want something i can wear and share with others the beautiful life i have. I am very lucky because i get to meet cool people and also experience awesome moments. It would be my honor to try out this new technology.Â ","url":"https://plus.google.com/113664673871091779349/posts/XhiMaEP6L7i","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12wszcxnziucdlxr04cclzzpmrlup3rqfg/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12wszcxnziucdlxr04cclzzpmrlup3rqfg/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12wszcxnziucdlxr04cclzzpmrlup3rqfg/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"Google Glass","content":"Have what it takes to be a Glass Explorer?
