You have no idea how long I&#39;ve been waiting for this type of product. I do trophytruck racing motocross and I even enjoy the occasional skydive. It is very difficult for me to film because products like the bulky Gopro series require helmets or other mounting devices. I recently invested in the Recond HUD extreme sports display which tracks top speeds, acceleration, flight and g-forces, however, the Recon lacks a camera. Please choose me to beta test your product I will capture remarkable footage, provide you with tons of feedback and demo all the ins-and-outs of all the functions Glass has to offer. I will attach some files to show you which products I am currently using, how I use them and in what settings I use them.<br />Thanks,<br />Thomas M","url":"https://plus.google.com/113536870246081783420/posts/PJptqMSxqds","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z131j5caxqjszpfo504cetmzaumzyznxjaw/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z131j5caxqjszpfo504cetmzaumzyznxjaw/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z131j5caxqjszpfo504cetmzaumzyznxjaw/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"Google Glass","content":"Have what it takes to be a Glass Explorer?
