I am a running start student in Washington, US. I would love to us the glasses to help google. As a running start student, I believe my incite with sports, high school classes, and full load of college classes will show you how valuable these glasses could possibly be.

Plus, I really want them. ","url":"https://plus.google.com/112791697960008021695/posts/6EqzRL25BDN","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z132z5y5pkmmjve0z23ks3cbcviicxxgs04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z132z5y5pkmmjve0z23ks3cbcviicxxgs04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z132z5y5pkmmjve0z23ks3cbcviicxxgs04/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
