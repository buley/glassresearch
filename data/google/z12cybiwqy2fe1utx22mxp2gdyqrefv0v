You reach the place where camera was, and play the movie in augmented mode, projected over the screen with certain opacity. <br /><br />use case B - you look out of your window, and an app finds movies shot in these locations, then you can sit back, relax and enjoy the movie you chose on Netflix. Great for use while travelling, connecting local with local movies helps you understand the local culture, memes, social norms. ","url":"https://plus.google.com/115220882337224830471/posts/BLuVn5REYz4","replies":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12cybiwqy2fe1utx22mxp2gdyqrefv0v/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12cybiwqy2fe1utx22mxp2gdyqrefv0v/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12cybiwqy2fe1utx22mxp2gdyqrefv0v/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Mobile"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
