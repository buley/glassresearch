My memories usually serve me well, but if I actually had a version of Project Glass, my work and play of the past and future would be remembered in a truly different way. Events such as eye witness accounts, vacations, even special, personal moments, such as your graduation or even your wedding would be forever changed! In the short term, I am planning to keep a log of all the times they were are and could be useful to further the development of software and make this as incredible as I believe it can be. <br /><br />PS- I am in the Bay Area and can pick up a Project Glass demo, or help in some way anytime! ;-)","url":"https://plus.google.com/101422802781507774834/posts/hHRHhj38HtX","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13mepazvpqosxuzk04ch5kyqnasulfqans0k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13mepazvpqosxuzk04ch5kyqnasulfqans0k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13mepazvpqosxuzk04ch5kyqnasulfqans0k/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"Google Glass","content":"Have what it takes to be a Glass Explorer?
