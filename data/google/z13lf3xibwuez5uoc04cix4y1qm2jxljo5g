First, I would use them in the classes that I substitute teacher for. This would be a great tool to video tape the class from my point of view and I could reflect on my teaching. I would then take the video and show it to my peers at the university I currently attend. This could be a great tool for my education classes. It would make me a better teacher! I would also use them while playing basketball. I think recording a video from my point of view would allow me to see where I look the most when I play basketball and I could improve my game from that. Lastly, I would use them this summer at my job. My family gives tours on the Silver Lake Sand Dunes in Mears Michigan. This would be a great way to take pictures and videos hands free. As well as mapping the route. I would love to test the device. I believe I would provide a lot of great feedback.Â ","url":"https://plus.google.com/118333849619334128123/posts/PtUNBJagWPB","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13lf3xibwuez5uoc04cix4y1qm2jxljo5g/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13lf3xibwuez5uoc04cix4y1qm2jxljo5g/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13lf3xibwuez5uoc04cix4y1qm2jxljo5g/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
