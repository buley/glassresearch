I am a 21 year old entrepreneur with a company and a clothing line that i just started with a friend that embodies creativity and innovation this is not different from the Google glass. The world will be passed down to my generation just as it was passed on to the generations before mines I plan on being in the forefront when this happens. I want to paint the world with creativity, innovation, hopes and dreams and much more before my generation passes it on to the next. I believe Google glass ability to share a unique perspective of the world is the perfect way to start. Thank you.
