I loved this video.  <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23ifihadglass\">#ifihadglass</a>  As a teacher, I would use this for education. I can imagine me making videos showing how to complete worksheets and uploading them online. Maybe even google hangouts as tutor sessions. Also when students miss labs, getting the information is difficult. I could wear Glass and post the video online with the data. Film lectures, professional development, meetings, there are a lot of cool things on the horizon for this technology. ","url":"https://plus.google.com/101432981120673892129/posts/gmdwPguUTse","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13wxtuwlmy2tfsrh04cglnaxxnii3iwjng0k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":2,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13wxtuwlmy2tfsrh04cglnaxxnii3iwjng0k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":2,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13wxtuwlmy2tfsrh04cglnaxxnii3iwjng0k/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"Google Glass","content":"Have what it takes to be a Glass Explorer?
