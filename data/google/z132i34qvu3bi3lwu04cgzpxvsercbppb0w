Very useful in projects where people try to fix/do stuff following instructions. Examples like fixing car problems, fixing house hold problems, cooking stuff etc. Glasses can elaborate on the each step while the user is performing the action. Also, can take picture of their problem and video/photo search on google for any answers in case of a hiccup.","url":"https://plus.google.com/112841462516440309829/posts/SrS3pCtZQHR","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z132i34qvu3bi3lwu04cgzpxvsercbppb0w/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z132i34qvu3bi3lwu04cgzpxvsercbppb0w/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z132i34qvu3bi3lwu04cgzpxvsercbppb0w/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"Google Glass","content":"Have what it takes to be a Glass Explorer?
