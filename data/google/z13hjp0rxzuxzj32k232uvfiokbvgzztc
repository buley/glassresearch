It would also be securely net-workable with my buds so we can easily take out multiple targets synchronously.

This should make the assault from multiple entry points a breeze. :D","url":"https://plus.google.com/110958196265700520287/posts/EQ5fcbG2PYd","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13hjp0rxzuxzj32k232uvfiokbvgzztc/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":3,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13hjp0rxzuxzj32k232uvfiokbvgzztc/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13hjp0rxzuxzj32k232uvfiokbvgzztc/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
