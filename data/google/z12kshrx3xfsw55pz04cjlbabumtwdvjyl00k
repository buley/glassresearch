I would also like it to sync and allow me to play songs from my Google Music cloud storage account through my car stereo. Voice-search through the songs would be great. I would also like it to give me vehicle diagnostics, upcoming maintenance, and track my routes in real-time and provide a new route if there is an accident, noting delays.","url":"https://plus.google.com/105493874789062607960/posts/YyeV39JYrSk","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12kshrx3xfsw55pz04cjlbabumtwdvjyl00k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12kshrx3xfsw55pz04cjlbabumtwdvjyl00k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12kshrx3xfsw55pz04cjlbabumtwdvjyl00k/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
