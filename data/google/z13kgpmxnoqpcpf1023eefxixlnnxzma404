I would begin moving my classroom even further into the 21st century. I would make videos of lessons for students who were missing or needed additional instruction. I would seek innovative ways to inspire my students to incorporate newer technology into the learning process.

I recently helped bring Chromebooks into my classroom via donors <a href=\"http://choose.org\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">choose.org</a>, andi just purchased a nexus for myself.  This just seems like the next logical step!)<br />","url":"https://plus.google.com/104934464539443514110/posts/6QnJJtLQrzj","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13kgpmxnoqpcpf1023eefxixlnnxzma404/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13kgpmxnoqpcpf1023eefxixlnnxzma404/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13kgpmxnoqpcpf1023eefxixlnnxzma404/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"photo","id":"104934464539443514110.5849331784021463842","content":"1361903200225.jpg","url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/104934464539443514110/albums/5849331784040750993/5849331784021463842?authkey=CPPj1p3ZgrKKOg","image":{"url":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8CA3T4MMkPY/US0ARDgAUyI/AAAAAAAAhpo/_TDuqN0VU9M/w497-h373/1361903200225.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","height":373,"width":497},"fullImage":{"url":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8CA3T4MMkPY/US0ARDgAUyI/AAAAAAAAhpo/_TDuqN0VU9M/s0-d/1361903200225.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","height":960,"width":1280}}]},"provider":{"title":"Mobile"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
