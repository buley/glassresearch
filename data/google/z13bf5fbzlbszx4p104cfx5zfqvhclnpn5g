I work at a major university and work with thousands of students every week.  So the first thing I would do is help them experience Glass and see what they think of it.  The students here love the next high tech items, and I think I would learn a lot by their perspectives.  <br /><br />The other thing would be to use it to help view life.  From baseball games to student concerts, comedians, festivals, and other events I would use it to help document life in student activities &amp; student affairs at a college.  This is one of the places where I think Glass can shine...as a way to demonstrate college life. ","url":"https://plus.google.com/101360524882365466855/posts/TxLnH3Do9a5","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13bf5fbzlbszx4p104cfx5zfqvhclnpn5g/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13bf5fbzlbszx4p104cfx5zfqvhclnpn5g/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13bf5fbzlbszx4p104cfx5zfqvhclnpn5g/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
