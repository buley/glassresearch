Why? So I could document what life is like with an ADHD/ODD child, life in general. So that I could share the small wonders of the world that mean so much to brighten someone else&#39;s day. I couldn&#39;t afford the $1500 pre-order requirement though - not sure that there are many who could in this economy. But one day I hopefully will be able to share with Google Glass ... because these two mean the world to me.","url":"https://plus.google.com/107085771023526039768/posts/5ubN3t4b9oG","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13xwrug5kidjrekx23mudz5fmzuxjly204/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":2,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13xwrug5kidjrekx23mudz5fmzuxjly204/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13xwrug5kidjrekx23mudz5fmzuxjly204/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"album","displayName":"","id":"107085771023526039768.5849350048100564897","url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/107085771023526039768/albums/5849350048100564897?authkey=CPObpZ7Hh7yg-AE","thumbnails":[{"url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/107085771023526039768/albums/5849350048100564897/5849350050027115618?authkey=CPObpZ7Hh7yg-AE","description":"","image":{"url":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-gtZiYKPERaU/US0Q4RrHlGI/AAAAAAAADSg/3pzySFCK6w4/w248-h248-p/Mechanicsville-20120622-00301.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","height":248,"width":248}},{"url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/107085771023526039768/albums/5849350048100564897/5849350078069843970?authkey=CPObpZ7Hh7yg-AE","description":"","image":{"url":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_Uj7V0_yPcU/US0Q56JBqAI/AAAAAAAADSo/MoJpEmVLavI/w248-h248-p/Mechanicsville-20120211-00102.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","height":248,"width":248}}]}]},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
