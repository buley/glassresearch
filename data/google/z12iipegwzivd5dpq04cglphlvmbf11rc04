I am legally blind, 20/200 vision, and assuming I could use Google glass over my prescription glasses, and assuming I can see the screen, this could be a great device for the visually impaired. I can only imagine standing in a fast food restaurant like MacDonald&#39;s, and using Glass&#39;s camera to zoom in on the menu over the counter so I can see it for the first time in my life. Not only that, but with the right applications, I can only imagine how it could help my kill count in games like Halo 4, which lets face it is way more important than helping me with boring stuff in real life. Glass detecting an enemy on screen for me like in Ghost Recon Future Soldier, now that is amazing.Â ","url":"https://plus.google.com/105419268610052585065/posts/XVX6mCFfQpB","replies":{"totalItems":2,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12iipegwzivd5dpq04cglphlvmbf11rc04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":9,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12iipegwzivd5dpq04cglphlvmbf11rc04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12iipegwzivd5dpq04cglphlvmbf11rc04/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
