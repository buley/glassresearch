I believe this would open up a whole new world for rising cinematographers and filmmakers and cameraman such as myself to not only introduce what we do to the world, but to help make the industry here come alive (even with a feature to document what I see and what ideas I have to share them with fellow Bahamians to result in a film or short piece)","url":"https://plus.google.com/109131213882924393522/posts/fnjodPM2GCS","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13hvfe4cw2evjwzb04cdz4yymbbj1kwsv00k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13hvfe4cw2evjwzb04cdz4yymbbj1kwsv00k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13hvfe4cw2evjwzb04cdz4yymbbj1kwsv00k/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
