I think most people do not realize how intricate this type of work is, and I would love to show people the work and thought that goes into the work that firefighters do to rescue people. I would also be able to film in the summer while fighting wild fire, to give people an up close and personal view of wildland fire suppression. I would love to film from inside a structure fire, but we are not allowed to wear glasses in a fire. Sad face.<br /><br />But in all, I think people would still enjoy seeing what I get to see regularly while doing heavy rescue.","url":"https://plus.google.com/115629477415616627055/posts/Y4SJqj9FoD6","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12msjawzl25vrq5t04cfhagfojwedcbfog0k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12msjawzl25vrq5t04cfhagfojwedcbfog0k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12msjawzl25vrq5t04cfhagfojwedcbfog0k/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
