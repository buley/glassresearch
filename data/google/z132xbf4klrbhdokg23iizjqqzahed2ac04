So many experiments, techniques and data could be recorded on a daily basis. All to propagate how cool science really is, and what happens &#39;behind the door&#39;. There is so much to miss when writing to a fellow scientist or broader public explaining what do you really do or how  does your day look like - you could just simply show it. And my lab book would be much more versatile. Can you imagine people reacting to how protein crystals are shot or how cells are lysed seeing it live? And young children to get involved into scientific endeavors from early on? Ok Glass... let show the world what scientists are doing!","url":"https://plus.google.com/116571097009641173381/posts/37gSWNVWxSx","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z132xbf4klrbhdokg23iizjqqzahed2ac04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z132xbf4klrbhdokg23iizjqqzahed2ac04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z132xbf4klrbhdokg23iizjqqzahed2ac04/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"photo","id":"116571097009641173381.5849638949762910002","content":"gg.png","url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/116571097009641173381/albums/5849638949554645153/5849638949762910002?authkey=CNPxiu6d5K693AE","image":{"url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Xo34VvheqXc/US4XodDoRzI/AAAAAAAAAko/aY1jAkQZIQY/w497-h373/gg.png","type":"image/jpeg","height":373,"width":497},"fullImage":{"url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Xo34VvheqXc/US4XodDoRzI/AAAAAAAAAko/aY1jAkQZIQY/gg.png","type":"image/jpeg","height":322,"width":1022}}]},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
