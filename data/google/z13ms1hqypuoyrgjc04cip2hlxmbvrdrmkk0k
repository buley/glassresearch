I am a cable technician and Google Glass could be used as a job assignment notification tool, a look-up tool for complex issues, a GPS for use between traveling to different customer locations, and a lot more functionality beyond that including creating a hangout to troubleshoot via first-person video with Tier 2 advanced technicians. This is currently done on an iPhone, and it&#39;s dangerous to perform half of these functions when driving between locations.<br /><br />For personal reasons, I could use it to capture beautiful moments with my family and other athletic activities, such as snowboarding.<br /><br />Really, I should change the hash link to <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23iwillhaveglass\">#iwillhaveglass</a> , because there is no doubt that when this becomes available to consumers I will be purchasing it.","url":"https://plus.google.com/111261262273048550493/posts/fsU96XnYRsA","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13ms1hqypuoyrgjc04cip2hlxmbvrdrmkk0k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":2,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13ms1hqypuoyrgjc04cip2hlxmbvrdrmkk0k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13ms1hqypuoyrgjc04cip2hlxmbvrdrmkk0k/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
