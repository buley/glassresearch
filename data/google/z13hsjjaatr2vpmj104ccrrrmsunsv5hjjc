I&#39;d love to see how games could work compared to that of a droid and how apps you develop on said device could change the way people view life and how life mixes with technology towards future generations of people on Earth. Even though I&#39;m still learning how to program myself, I think it&#39;d be an amazing opportunity to develop apps for such a free form mobile device, because unlike a smart phone, the Google Glass would allow for a constantly view-able, constantly accessible mobile platform. This opens up the range because with a phone you have storage and time down. With this, you could do many more tech changing apps.","url":"https://plus.google.com/107483550199009546375/posts/ejMFuDQY6Ft","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13hsjjaatr2vpmj104ccrrrmsunsv5hjjc/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13hsjjaatr2vpmj104ccrrrmsunsv5hjjc/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13hsjjaatr2vpmj104ccrrrmsunsv5hjjc/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
