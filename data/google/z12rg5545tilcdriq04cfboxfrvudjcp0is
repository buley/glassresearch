Most people describe how they would use Google  Glass to record things and share them with others. My first idea (and still the best one I can come up with) is to use it as an information provider in situations where I can&#39;t (or don&#39;t want to) use actual screens. My teaching and talks I give would be so much better with the slides available through Glass than having to look at a screen. (Sure, rehearsing is an option too - but who has time for that? ;))<br />Having what&#39;s essentially a HUD on a bike isn&#39;t half bad either, neither is the ability to get sent information without interrupting meetings / conversation.<br /><br />Sure, being able to record things on the fly is neat but I find the display capabilities much more intriguing.<br /><br />I can&#39;t decide whether Glass is actually really useful without a proper way to control it, though. Voice control defeats the purpose, and touching your head all the time seems awkward. We&#39;ll see I guess. Since I don&#39;t live in the US, I doubt I&#39;ll get to try it personally anytime soon though.","url":"https://plus.google.com/116463949272570099193/posts/cv7urxp3qCH","replies":{"totalItems":2,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12rg5545tilcdriq04cfboxfrvudjcp0is/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":4,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12rg5545tilcdriq04cfboxfrvudjcp0is/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12rg5545tilcdriq04cfboxfrvudjcp0is/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
