Not only that but id be able to stream my class to those who are missing the day or fail to appear. Not only could I benefit the classroom but the student body wholly. I could capture real student behavior and even use it against bullies and they&#39;re tactics. Overall I&#39;d use Google Glass to not only amuse myself but to help others.","url":"https://plus.google.com/109688619266158339733/posts/DUpVtWeWYY6","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12jxpyhdmb3dlnme220db1hbxf0vzdgo04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12jxpyhdmb3dlnme220db1hbxf0vzdgo04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12jxpyhdmb3dlnme220db1hbxf0vzdgo04/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
