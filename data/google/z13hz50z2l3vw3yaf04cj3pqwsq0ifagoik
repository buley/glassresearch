Which I am already working on, since 2007. Then I would start developing games, with advertising platforms embedded into the location based Glass system. I would also make an application, that could make one Glass system identify another Glass system, and then automatically provide communication through Google + for Social Networking in a seamless way. This is one of the greatest inventions ever!","url":"https://plus.google.com/110468837056156881476/posts/b7VKUcgWZUe","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13hz50z2l3vw3yaf04cj3pqwsq0ifagoik/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13hz50z2l3vw3yaf04cj3pqwsq0ifagoik/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13hz50z2l3vw3yaf04cj3pqwsq0ifagoik/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
