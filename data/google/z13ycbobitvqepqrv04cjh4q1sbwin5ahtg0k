A QR code reader and a custom website could allow you to control web-enabled devices.<br /><br />Expanding it into other Google products, home automation is where I could have seen the failed Nexus Q shine. Tied into a homes wireless network, and with the addition of some wireless speakers and microphones (or using Google Glass as an input), it could use the voice recognition platform used for Google Now. Enabling voice commands from any room in the house and receiving a response to them is very reminiscent of the computer interface from Star Trek: The Next Generation (though without the need for a Self-Destruct Mechanism)","url":"https://plus.google.com/117820239697245338959/posts/j6rwLY3VyLo","replies":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13ycbobitvqepqrv04cjh4q1sbwin5ahtg0k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13ycbobitvqepqrv04cjh4q1sbwin5ahtg0k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13ycbobitvqepqrv04cjh4q1sbwin5ahtg0k/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"Google Glass","content":"Have what it takes to be a Glass Explorer?
