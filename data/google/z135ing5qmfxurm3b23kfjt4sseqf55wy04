Like magnetic fields, or location and strength of wi-fi hotspots. Or bluetooth devices near me. The idea is to give extra sensory input. That input won&#39;t be in usual format (like location to and name of wi-fi), but instead will code information visually (for example, for wi-fi strength can be coded as color, popularity as shape, and proximity as size). The ultimate goal is to teach brain to recognize that visual information without thinking about it (like you would naturally move to a place where there is a good free wi-fi, just because it feels better in that additional sensory input).","url":"https://plus.google.com/111256265619222022507/posts/JKiJCNoBuxu","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z135ing5qmfxurm3b23kfjt4sseqf55wy04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z135ing5qmfxurm3b23kfjt4sseqf55wy04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z135ing5qmfxurm3b23kfjt4sseqf55wy04/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
