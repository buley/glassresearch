On a monthly basis we&#39;ll get Ferraris, Aston Martins, and once we got a Lambo. We go up and down a very narrow 7-story helix dozens of times a day. It&#39;s so narrow and scary to most of the public that they want to valet just so that they don&#39;t have to do it. Oh, I forgot to mention that we go blazing down this helix since we&#39;re so used to it. I&#39;ve always wanted a GoPro to record myself driving, but they&#39;re so big and clunky that they would never let me wear it at work. But the Google Glasses are so slick and tiny that it wouldn&#39;t present a problem. I&#39;d love to test out the video sharing capabilities of the Google Glasses!","url":"https://plus.google.com/111784188590651061622/posts/N6uZu4w8G2m","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13hfrogjw2fvj53y23ivvpzvxqzvpq1h/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13hfrogjw2fvj53y23ivvpzvxqzvpq1h/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13hfrogjw2fvj53y23ivvpzvxqzvpq1h/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
