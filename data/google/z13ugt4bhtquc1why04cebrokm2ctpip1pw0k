I would wear them around to my college classes so I could take notes without having to write. I would document my days and take videos and pictures so that I can look back someday and remember all the moments I shared with important people in my life. I would share them with other, responsible people so that they could experience how awesome the glasses are. I would use my glasses while I&#39;m watching Rachel Ray so I can actually copy down her recipes since I don&#39;t have DVR and I can&#39;t rewind my television. I would use my glasses to move forward in the world. And even if I did not provide enough reason to get a pair of Google Glass, rest assured that I would use them every single day.","url":"https://plus.google.com/102601246180150418703/posts/YvoZ4Z1GfcP","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13ugt4bhtquc1why04cebrokm2ctpip1pw0k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13ugt4bhtquc1why04cebrokm2ctpip1pw0k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13ugt4bhtquc1why04cebrokm2ctpip1pw0k/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
