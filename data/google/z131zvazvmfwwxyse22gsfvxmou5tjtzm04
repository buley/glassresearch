I would want to help develop new ideas to be put into glass. There is so much potential in these things other than just taking pictures. I mean, it could easily be a way to be a wireless information distributor, instead of saying &quot;glass, take a pic,&quot; say, &quot;glass, make my payment&quot; if I where in a store for example. Simple ways to make out lives easy so one day you won&#39;t need a phone to work with Glass. Ways to take the phone out of your pocket and make it something visual.
