This would be an excellent resource to help engage students. Putting randomized test questions in front of a student&#39;s eyes that they could answer with a simple gesture would help as an assessment tool.<br /><br />This could also be used in science to use scanning of rocks, plants, etc, to show pertinent data in a classroom or nature walk setting and in helping to name organs as you dissect a frog or earthworm.<br /><br />In English, it could provide word etymology, changes in definition and/or use over time, where various phrases come from, providing the opportunity for assessment through the glass as well. Historical authors and brief segments of their books and similar books (I have used this with Hunger Games) in real-time.<br /><br />I would also imagine that mind maps for various bodies of knowledge could be explored so that in any subject, relevant and pertinent information is linked so that learning can be visualized in a structured manner. Interacting with this information by voice with applicable examples and references could be a tremendous learning tool that would also enable children to have a holistic view of education and see how all of the different bodies of knowledge are related and interact with one another. It would also have the ability to isolate the map based on voice or written commands to get more drilled down information.<br /><br />I have a TON more on this!","url":"https://plus.google.com/105493874789062607960/posts/XPZYA6G1Fco","replies":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13mcbmzumumwdpxp04cjlbabumtwdvjyl00k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13mcbmzumumwdpxp04cjlbabumtwdvjyl00k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13mcbmzumumwdpxp04cjlbabumtwdvjyl00k/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
