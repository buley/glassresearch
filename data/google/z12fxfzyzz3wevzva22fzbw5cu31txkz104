As things currently stand, students have access to my lecture notes that I share with them on the cloud. Students occasionally become sick and they miss out on the instruction going on within the classroom - I would use Glass to display the lessons that coincide with my lecture notes on the cloud. My students may not be in the classroom, but they don&#39;t have to miss a day of instruction. Additionally, on a more practical level, Glass would facilitate the quick fact check that students and teachers appreciate. If a question deems it, I can quickly look through the Glass and find an answer.","url":"https://plus.google.com/102579553578113529160/posts/JEBTzNwfE5k","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12fxfzyzz3wevzva22fzbw5cu31txkz104/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12fxfzyzz3wevzva22fzbw5cu31txkz104/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12fxfzyzz3wevzva22fzbw5cu31txkz104/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
