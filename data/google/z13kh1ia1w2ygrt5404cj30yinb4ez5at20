I feel overtime it will add more features and opportunities.  I feel that Glass could be something I could use for my college too, so I can keep up with emails, contacts, and research materials for subjects that I take in class.  I feel like if I were to have this technology I would use Glass to it&#39;s full potential and looking forward to what it has to offer. <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23ifihadglass\">#ifihadglass</a>","url":"https://plus.google.com/105290242501112996568/posts/UZdViynpNmD","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13kh1ia1w2ygrt5404cj30yinb4ez5at20/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13kh1ia1w2ygrt5404cj30yinb4ez5at20/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13kh1ia1w2ygrt5404cj30yinb4ez5at20/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
