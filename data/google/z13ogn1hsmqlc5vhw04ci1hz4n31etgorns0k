The idea can be described as &quot;like for places&quot;. When you like (or dislike) the place you currently at you can say &quot;I like this place&quot; / &quot;I hate this place&quot;. After that you will see places from people that also liked / hated this place. Places that are liked more will get better colors (like warm colors), places that hated more will get cold colors. So the idea is to show places where you will most likely feel good and warn you about places where you will probably feel bad. There of course be social integration, in fact you can make friends (add to circles) people that like / hate places that you do.","url":"https://plus.google.com/111256265619222022507/posts/Yb6gtPZZ2bH","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13ogn1hsmqlc5vhw04ci1hz4n31etgorns0k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13ogn1hsmqlc5vhw04ci1hz4n31etgorns0k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13ogn1hsmqlc5vhw04ci1hz4n31etgorns0k/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
