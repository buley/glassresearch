It would be able to display on demand the status of a computer or server in reply to queries like: &quot;What is &lt;host name/ip address&gt; &#39;s uptime?&quot;, or &quot;Show me the memory usage of &lt;host name/ ip address&gt;&quot;. It would also show the collected stat and uptime history as well, and sync it all to Drive or the storage platform of your choice. I would also try and hook it up to  <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23Blender3d\">#Blender3d</a>  to let you see your objects in the real world, position the camera, and render, all from Glass. You would also be able to automatically reccord the movements of the camera, making animating the camera a cinch.","url":"https://plus.google.com/113743706028575422245/posts/Pv19ywyV1vr","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13dvzppxpb4crzwc04cfb4ocvfmjrt4ows0k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13dvzppxpb4crzwc04cfb4ocvfmjrt4ows0k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13dvzppxpb4crzwc04cfb4ocvfmjrt4ows0k/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
