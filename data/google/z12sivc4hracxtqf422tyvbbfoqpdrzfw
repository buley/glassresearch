The design of Glass is beautiful. If I had Glass, I would test the boundaries of human nature in by making beautiful first person films. I would never forget to take notes because Glass would take them for me, and it would change art because of its unique and powerful first person perspective.  Just now as I made my Glass application video, I thought that my video would be better without holding a camera and experiencing life as it should be, hands free. With Glass, life would become so much easier to communicate, but also, more fun. I am not afraid of the unknown and have worn glasses my whole life so using Glass would be like seeing an old friend again. I didn&#39;t know what I was going to do for my application video so I decided that i would make it fun a la Google style in the snow.  Thank you for reading and for the opportunity to participate in such an amazing program.","url":"https://plus.google.com/108271824007715513236/posts/HqvfT5Wi26s","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12sivc4hracxtqf422tyvbbfoqpdrzfw/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12sivc4hracxtqf422tyvbbfoqpdrzfw/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12sivc4hracxtqf422tyvbbfoqpdrzfw/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"video","displayName":"Glass-JHK.m4v","id":"108271824007715513236.5849836098048380946","content":"My Project Glass Video","url":"https://plus.google.com/photos/108271824007715513236/albums/5849836093149362161/5849836098048380946?authkey=CLL1-4Ta9Yz_fg","image":{"url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-r3-83dpjBWA/US7K7_puUBI/AAAAAAAAABI/CRJ5JJr1rmk/s288/Glass-JHK.m4v","type":"image/jpeg","height":360,"width":640}}]},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
