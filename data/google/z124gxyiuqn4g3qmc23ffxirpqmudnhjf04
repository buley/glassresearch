My students love technology and engage in lessons that are immersed with some form of modern tech. Honestly, Google glass would be perfect. Tablets are great, but they really have a &quot;toy&quot; like feel when students use them, whereas Glass would allow me to show them how connectivity allows for more than tweet updates and apps.<br /><br />In terms of my teacher, I could use Glass to better show how perspective works, how ideas are connected, how the various aspects of the curriculum interact and inform many aspects of their daily lives, and most importantly, provide my students with a clear understanding of where technology is going, and how to properly use it as a tool and not just a toy (again, an opportunity I feel was lost when tablets became mainstream). <br /><br />From my position, it would also greatly help with my pedagogy in that it would make it far easier to help integrate my students back into the mainstream class. It would greatly facilitate co-teaching opportunities, allowing my students to be more apart of the mainstream class, while getting the extra support and accommodations in the withdrawal program. And, as noted, it would help keep students engaged in the material, which is paramount for learning.","url":"https://plus.google.com/112547521835392419271/posts/DAMK6YBrzzs","replies":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z124gxyiuqn4g3qmc23ffxirpqmudnhjf04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z124gxyiuqn4g3qmc23ffxirpqmudnhjf04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z124gxyiuqn4g3qmc23ffxirpqmudnhjf04/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
