I would explore ways in which they could be used in the development of new projects linking artists and academics, exploring their use in the creation of new artistic projects. I would commission international and UK-based artists to use Google Glass in making dance, theatre and new media, music, visual arts, work for families and young people, exploring research and narratives around mathematics, physics, economics, sociology, politics, engineering, neuroscience, psychology, philosophy and business (amongst many others). I would explore how they could be used to enhance the experience of audiences experiencing live, visual and media work in and around the venue, how we might interact differently in the future with our audiences, what people might look for in a 21st, and towards a 22nd, century arts organisation, in adapting to and using new technologies. We would play seriously and seriously play, and test and push the limits of what might be possible.Â <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23ifihadglass\">#ifihadglass</a>","url":"https://plus.google.com/107412455132307364274/posts/DkFC8ZhS4aR","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12niv3rmzmthtaeg22cdd5ogtujwqgc/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12niv3rmzmthtaeg22cdd5ogtujwqgc/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12niv3rmzmthtaeg22cdd5ogtujwqgc/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"This_is_Tomorrow","content":"This_Is_Tomorrow sets out to generate new artistic ideas through artist and academic collaborations.","url":"http://www.warwickartscentre.co.uk/project/projects/this_is_tomorrow","image":{"url":"https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http://www.warwickartscentre.co.uk/mmlib/includes/sendimage.php?path%3D3336.5597.ImageforThisisTom.JPG%26width%3D200%26height%3D200%26folder%3Deventfiles&container=focus&gadget=a&rewriteMime=image/*&refresh=31536000&resize_h=150&resize_w=150&no_expand=1","type":"image/jpeg","height":150,"width":150},"fullImage":{"url":"http://www.warwickartscentre.co.uk/mmlib/includes/sendimage.php?path=3336.5597.ImageforThisisTom.JPG&width=200&height=200&folder=eventfiles","type":"image/jpeg"}}]},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
