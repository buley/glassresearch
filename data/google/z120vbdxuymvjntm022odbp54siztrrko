Telling someone how to position a gun in your field of view, line up the sights, and lead the clay target is all well and good, but imagine how well you could show it. or learn it, if you had a first-person view. Call of Duty in the real world? People would be banging down the door! I&#39;d also use one of the many android driving assistance apps and try to have the glasses act as a HUD. I wonder if you could somehow display data like speed and closeness to other cars directly to the glasses... I could also try hands free reading while walking too, dangerous but I&#39;d be more productive. Edit: Â  If glasses could identify a word by &quot;seeing&quot; it, could it be a hands-free audio dictionary while studying! Or stop oblivious drivers from missing an exit.","url":"https://plus.google.com/109390116401299547933/posts/BqgbnordFHz","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z120vbdxuymvjntm022odbp54siztrrko/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z120vbdxuymvjntm022odbp54siztrrko/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z120vbdxuymvjntm022odbp54siztrrko/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
