I travel a lot so I would have plenty to share! I do photography as a hobby so that would be my primary use. Since I live in Chicago there is always so many things to see and great views to capture such as the amazing view from the Willis Tower! If I Had Glass,I would use them daily to create video memoirs. I would never miss an opportunity to miss all of the amazing sights of the Windy City. Memories can fade but, If I Had Glass, they will be infinite!Â ","url":"https://plus.google.com/116466882575190677524/posts/8X9rufZUYsF","replies":{"totalItems":2,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12veluy1z2rxhylg23dzzipoqe5jnipk04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12veluy1z2rxhylg23dzzipoqe5jnipk04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12veluy1z2rxhylg23dzzipoqe5jnipk04/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
