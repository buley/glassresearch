For example, to find my way to classes on campus, to find specific buildings or to set reminders for deadlines or events I need to attend. Or to take videos/pictures/audio notes during lectures, so I could replay them later and review. Or to find out where I can grab something to eat between class breaks. Or even simple things like waking me up, or setting up notes so I could easily study course material while walking or biking, or even while exercising at the gym. Glass would be perfect for me as a college student!","url":"https://plus.google.com/114668381184601893668/posts/UUcygYskTPc","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12zyz2x4uabw1cp404cdxig0u3gyfwgqes/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12zyz2x4uabw1cp404cdxig0u3gyfwgqes/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12zyz2x4uabw1cp404cdxig0u3gyfwgqes/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
