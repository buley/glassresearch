It&#39;d be pretty cool to get first person views fishing, hunting, snowboarding, longboarding, driving, everything. I think it&#39;d be cool to be able to showcase the beauty of Alaska :) ","url":"https://plus.google.com/117229219460516075813/posts/ZsoU8RK4Cuf","replies":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13dcthb2nnuhdlq404cgjirqym1dnkrhmo0k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13dcthb2nnuhdlq404cgjirqym1dnkrhmo0k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13dcthb2nnuhdlq404cgjirqym1dnkrhmo0k/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
