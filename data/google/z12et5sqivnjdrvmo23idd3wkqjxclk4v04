There has been a gigantic hill I&#39;ve been dying to bike down, bringing me in speeds in excess of 45-50mph with no pedaling. With glass, I will have that experience forever engraved in video. With glass, I&#39;d track my biking routes, explore NYC, hell, I&#39;d even start filming for the movie I&#39;ve been planning for over a year. If I had glass, I&#39;d finally push myself to do everything I&#39;ve been dying to do - through the glass.","url":"https://plus.google.com/112806445149852792976/posts/FCG194oBQM2","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12et5sqivnjdrvmo23idd3wkqjxclk4v04/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12et5sqivnjdrvmo23idd3wkqjxclk4v04/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12et5sqivnjdrvmo23idd3wkqjxclk4v04/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
