This what I am a part of everyday here at Clear Channel Media Entertainment.  How about seeing things through my eyes as I work the iHeart  performance theater live, here in Philadelphia.  The On-Air Jocks will be so jealous, the Artist that perform will want them.   Keeping up with my Facebook, checking  my e-Mail on the fly. Just plain bad ass from the startup.  Taking my day to day to the next level, push the limits. That’s what we do here at Clear Channel Media Entertainment, pushing the limits, embracing change is what we do day to day. So if I have the opportunity to sport these bad boys “ Google Interactive glasses, to our next level, Watch out Apple, here we come.  Please, Pick Me!! I would love to be part of the awesome evolution of Google.  <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23ifihadglass\">#ifihadglass</a>","url":"https://plus.google.com/112529063239341304301/posts/XSmHQ488mXs","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13fgdqhsnjrid0hq04chhijol3ecfpafrg0k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13fgdqhsnjrid0hq04chhijol3ecfpafrg0k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13fgdqhsnjrid0hq04chhijol3ecfpafrg0k/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"Google Glass","content":"","url":"http://www.google.com/glass/start/how-it-feels/","image":{"url":"https://images3-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http://www.google.com/glass/start/assets/img/og.jpg&container=focus&gadget=a&rewriteMime=image/*&refresh=31536000&resize_h=150&resize_w=150&no_expand=1","type":"image/jpeg","height":150,"width":150},"fullImage":{"url":"http://www.google.com/glass/start/assets/img/og.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"}}]},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
