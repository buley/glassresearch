I would put it to the test as far as translating and navigating different cultures and using the resulting footage to produce a constantly updated website with the experience. I am a fond believer that the more we learn about others the more we learn about ourselves. And as Anais Nin once said, &quot;We don&#39;t see things as they are, we see things as we are.&quot;Â  If I can use Glass to share my unique perspective of the world with others, while simultaneously exposing followers to other cultures, then hopefully we can help more people find their own perspective, inspiring them to capture their life with Glass as well, eventually leading to more empathy amongst the world.","url":"https://plus.google.com/117090319759696630445/posts/ieF2GiP95uE","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13mwjr4awzrcxyzs04chjfg5xnqdp3qoi4/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13mwjr4awzrcxyzs04chjfg5xnqdp3qoi4/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13mwjr4awzrcxyzs04chjfg5xnqdp3qoi4/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"Google Glass","content":"Have what it takes to be a Glass Explorer?
