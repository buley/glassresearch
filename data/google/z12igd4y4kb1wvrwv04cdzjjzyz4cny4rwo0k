I would capture moments and interactions with people, to look back on and learn from. I would us it in classes, and record my lessons to re watch later in the week. I would use it to help people start to embrace new technology, by showing them how fun, intuitive, and useful our gadgets are becoming. I would love to be a Google Glass Explorer, because it would allow me become a catalyst for difference in the paradigm of human interaction.","url":"https://plus.google.com/101046061702780125033/posts/T3wXsicY7Ej","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12igd4y4kb1wvrwv04cdzjjzyz4cny4rwo0k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12igd4y4kb1wvrwv04cdzjjzyz4cny4rwo0k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12igd4y4kb1wvrwv04cdzjjzyz4cny4rwo0k/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
