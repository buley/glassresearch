Once I reach the peak of the tallest mountain, I will tie myself to said mountain with the longest rope known to man and leap into the atmosphere with only a fishbowl to protect my head from bursting into smithereens. Once  I reach space, I will head for the moon and taste all of the finest cheese that is on offer. This cheese will also provide the building blocks to create a small home where I can catch a few z&#39;s before I start creating a new civilization. ","url":"https://plus.google.com/104520267331363324680/posts/E9hYUEpSvCV","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z133gdhr0ueotjnui23iy3cwcrv2s31f0/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z133gdhr0ueotjnui23iy3cwcrv2s31f0/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z133gdhr0ueotjnui23iy3cwcrv2s31f0/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
