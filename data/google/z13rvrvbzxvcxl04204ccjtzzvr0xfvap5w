Charting key locations like the white house, the Mounument, Gallery place, Georgetown. As well as my favorite destination... Home, where I spend hours chasing my 18 month son around as he explores learning how to play the pino (I have a little baby Mozart), as well as sports as he learns how to play basketball, which usually turns into a baseball/ soccer lesson all in one! I will also use it to show the little known biking trails in rock creek park, Georgetown and Fairfax, VA. As well as rock climbing at the mouth of the Potomac river! Typical 25 year old life in Washington, DC!","url":"https://plus.google.com/110719915871221961135/posts/NkDVNQHoRSN","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13rvrvbzxvcxl04204ccjtzzvr0xfvap5w/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13rvrvbzxvcxl04204ccjtzzvr0xfvap5w/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13rvrvbzxvcxl04204ccjtzzvr0xfvap5w/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"Google Glass","content":"Have what it takes to be a Glass Explorer?
