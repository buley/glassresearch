I would go to the extremes for opportunity to help change lives. Not as quite as suicide though..... But to have the chance to better a persons life is truly wonderful.  I know these glasses will simplify ones life. I would love to help and own these amazing glasses but I dont have the money to get one. I dont expect them to be free either. I am only writing this because I&#39;ve been employed for 7 years in a warehouse doing the same thing every day. Im looking for a way out, something different to change my life. I dont want to win this, only because I dont have money to spend. But if theres anything I can do to help better this project or a chance to work for google please contact me.
