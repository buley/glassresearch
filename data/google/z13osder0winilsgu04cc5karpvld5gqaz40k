These types of catheters afford patients the luxury of easy and painless infusions (i.e. chemo, antibiotics, etc.) as well as blood draws without needing to be poked; I have seen patients have a single PICC for a couple of years even. The world of vascular access is limitless &amp; the innovations related to this field have increased dramatically in the last 30 years. Unfortunately the knowledge base patients &amp; caregivers need to have as well as healthcare porofessionals including nurses &amp; physicians hasn&#39;t had a chance to align with the dramatic increase leaving a huge knowledge deficit related to vascular access which is scary since practically 99% of patients receive some sort of vascular access device upon hospital admission. Using Google Glass would be a great opportunity to help bridge this knowledge gap for not only patients &amp; caregivers but also for healthcare professionals who use, order, instruct, care for, maintain, remove, etc. these devices. (FYI</s> patient consent can be obtained to legally obtain necessary permission to record/take pictures of a PICC insertion involving actual patients as well as release the entire content &amp; rights so that it can be used for educational purposes). This would be an awesome opportunity I would take very seriously to help advance the field of vascular access.
