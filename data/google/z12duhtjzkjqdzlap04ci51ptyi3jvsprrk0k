An active, dry electrode cap (10/20 distribution) would detect event-related desynchronizations of the mu-rhythm using cross-correlation feature extraction. The associated app would realize a non-verbal alternative control modality for Glass leveraging thought alone. Enormous potential for medical and mainstream applications.","url":"https://plus.google.com/101951466323010077285/posts/ciYHkDZ8Gae","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12duhtjzkjqdzlap04ci51ptyi3jvsprrk0k/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":2,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12duhtjzkjqdzlap04ci51ptyi3jvsprrk0k/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12duhtjzkjqdzlap04ci51ptyi3jvsprrk0k/people/resharers"},"attachments":[{"objectType":"article","displayName":"Google Glass","content":"Have what it takes to be a Glass Explorer?
