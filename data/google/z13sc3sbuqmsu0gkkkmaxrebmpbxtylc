To be able to show my customer interactions and the day to day of my job can really put things into perspective for people who don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to work in retail. We always get a bad rap because our jobs are too easy but in reality, it can be harsh and many of us have an &quot;always on&quot; schedule that if our employer needs us, we have to be there. So this is for opening up the world a little bit more for everyone to see.","url":"https://plus.google.com/105120962808052002901/posts/14ouZZz83zP","replies":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13sc3sbuqmsu0gkkkmaxrebmpbxtylc/comments"},"plusoners":{"totalItems":1,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13sc3sbuqmsu0gkkkmaxrebmpbxtylc/people/plusoners"},"resharers":{"totalItems":0,"selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13sc3sbuqmsu0gkkkmaxrebmpbxtylc/people/resharers"}},"provider":{"title":"Google+"},"access":{"kind":"plus#acl"}}
